    "text": "The Department of Plant Molecular Biology was established in 1988 under the Faculty of Interdisciplinary \nand Applied Sciences to cater to the needs of students in frontier areas of plant biology and to carry out \nresearch on Molecular Aspects of Plant Biology and B iotechnology. The D epartment was enriched by \nmerger of the Unit for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology in 1988 (originally established by the DST), and \naward of  C OSIST gr ant by  t he U GC ( 1990-1995). The  Department has  been r ecognized f or S pecial \nAssistance P rogramme ( DRS P hase I  t o P hase I II) by  t he U GC ( 2002-2018) t o s trengthen \nresearch/teaching in the area of Functional Genomics. Since its establishment in 1988, Professor S.C. \nMaheshwari (1988- 1992), Professor Akhilesh K. Tyagi (1988, 1992-95, 1998-2001), Professor Jitendra \nP. Khurana (1995-1998, 2001- 2004, 2014 - 2016), Professor Paramjit Khurana (2004 - 2007, 2016- till \ndate), Professor Anil Grover (2007-2010), Professor I ndranil Dasgupta ( 2010 - 2013), and Professor \nMadan Mohan (2013 - 2014) have served as Heads of the Department.  \nFaculty members of the Department have undertaken several prestigious projects, many of which were \nfunded by the Rockefeller Rice Biotechnology Program, between the years 1990 and 2000, which helped \nthe Department make significant strides in acquiring expertise in transgenics and structural and \nfunctional anal ysis of  g enes. W ith t he begi nning of  t he new  millennium, faculty members of t he \nDepartment took up challenges of large-scale genome sequencing and analysis, which resulted in the \nlandmark achievement of generating the complete sequence of the rice genome, as part of an \ninternational consortium of scientists, in the year 2005. This was followed by a s imilar achievement for \nthe c ompletion of  t he t omato genom e i n t he year 2012.  C urrently, t he departmental faculty i s part of \nInternational Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium. The research has also been supported by major \ngrants in the form of “Centre for Plant Molecular Biology” and “Genome Initiatives on Sequencing, Gene \nDiscovery and Function” by D BT, in addition to other competitive grants from DST, UGC, E uropean \nCommission and t he R ockefeller Foundat ion. T he f aculty i s i nvolved i n m ulti–institutional as  w ell as  \ninternational pr ojects. The r esearch has yielded about  750 publ ications in journals of  r epute, such as \nNature, Genome Research, Nucleic Acids Research, Trends in Biotechnology, Plant Physiology, New \nPhytologist, Journal of Experimental Botany, Plant Cell & Environment and Bioessays alongwith several \npatents as well. Efforts of the faculty have been recognized in the form of fellowships to \nnational/international s cientific ac ademies and nat\nional/international awards. W hile pr oviding due \nemphasis for basic research and training, the Department endeavors to convert knowledge into \napplication for human welfare.  \nThe alumni of this Department have spread out all over the World and occupy several important \npositions i n w ell-known uni versities and research i nstitutes (including W ashington S tate U niversity, \nPullman, USA; University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA; Texas Tech University Health Sciences Centre, \nUSA; R othamstead R esearch S tation, H ertfordshire, U K) or  ar e w orking as  pos t-doctoral f ellows in  \nresearch e stablishments ac ross the W orld.

Similarly \nsRNAs have emerged as a major modulators of global gene expression patterns. Thus, this course is \ndesigned to develop an in-depth understanding of the interplay of sRNAs and epigenetic modifications in \nregulating various molecular processes in plants. \nCourse outcome \nThe candidate would understand how various molecular processes maintain the epigenetic status of the \nplant genom e. Th ey w ill al so under stand how  the epigenetic s tatus i s i nterpreted by  t he molecular \nmachinery to modulate various biochemical and developmental pr ocesses in plants. Further, they will \nalso l earn how  s RNA mediated r egulatory pr ocesses ar e i mplicated i n m aintaining plant epi genetic \nstatus. \nContents \n• \nUnit 1: Chromatin Modeling and Remodeling -- Polycomb complexes, SWI/SNF1 complexes \nand other chromatin modifiers. \n• \nUnit 2: Interpretation of DNA Methylation Marks by Cellular Machinery -- Study of \nmethylated D NA bi nding pr oteins, t heir s tructure and f\nunction, methods of  al tering D NA \nmethylation. \n• \nUnit 3: Study of Histone Modifications -- Histone modifications, modifying enzymes, histone \ndeacetylase inhibitors. \n• \nUnit 4: Chromatin Modification and Development -- Effect on  s omatic em bryogenesis, l eaf \ndevelopment, photosynthesis, flowering and ageing. \n• \nUnit 5: Epigenetics and Environment -- Role in plant stresses, epigenetic memory. \n• \nUnit 6: Epigenetics in Human Systems -- Role in immune response, cancer and cardiovascular \ndiseases. \n• \nUnit 7: Non-coding RNAs -- Types and occurrence of non-coding RNAs, small RNAs in different \nbiological systems, diversity and evolution of small RNAs. \n• \nUnit 8: Identification and Characterization of Small RNAs -- Discovery, detection and \nvalidation of small RNAs, target prediction and validation, databases on small RNAs, an overview \nof bioinformatics tools in small RNA biology. \nDepartment of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus  \n \n55 \n• \nUnit 9: Small RNA Pathways - Biogenesis of different classes of small RNAs, components and \ntheir characteristic features.  \n• \nUnit 10: Regulation of Gene Expression by Small RNAs -- Transcriptional gene s ilencing \n(TGS), Po st-transcriptional G ene S ilencing ( PTGS), gene a ctivation, e volutionary transition of  \nsmall RNA-target gene pair. \n• \nUnit 11: Biological Processes Regulated by Small RNAs -- Diverse roles of small RNAs in \nregulating biological processes in different organisms: bacteria, plants & animals, trans-kingdom \ncross-talk mediated by small RNAs. \n• \nUnit 12: Small Non-coding RNAs as Effective Tools in Biotechnology -- amiR technology, \nsiRNA t echnology, V irus-induced gene silencing ( VIGS), R NA I nterference ( RNAi) and R NA \nactivation (RNAa), target mimicry, Short tandem target mimic technology (STTM) & miR sponges, \nCRISPR-Cas m ediated genom e edi ting technology, c rop i mprovement, di agnostics and  \ntherapeutic applications in human diseases.  \n• \nUnit 13: Hands-on Training -- Techniques f or s tudying di fferential m ethylation of  D NA, gene \nexpression in response to altered DNA methylation, expression profiling of small RNAs, survey of \nsmall RNA databases, case studies of plant miRNA families. \n \nSuggested Readings \n1.

The student shall spend the entire Semester-4 in experimentation and \nstudy on the topic and shall submit the Dissertation in bound form at the end of the semester.  \n \nCourse objectives \nThis course is designed to provide extensive practical training to the students so as to enable them to \nconceive a research problem, design experimental strategy, conduct experiments as well as compile and \ndiscuss the results. The students are required to work in the research labs of the Department and thus \nare exposed to the actual research and development environment in the filed of plant sciences.    \n \nCourse outcome \nThe candidates would learn how to independently pursue a research problems. They would understand \nhow a r esearch pr oblem is f ormulated based on available r esearch dat a and s ocio-economic impact. \nCandidates will also develop practical skills for accurately conducting various molecular and biochemical \ntechniques. They will also develop understanding about how the experimental data is compiled, \nanalyzed and discussed in light of previously available literature data. Thus, this paper would provide a \nglimpse of how actual research in plant biological is conducted.",
