    "text": "The Act that created the University of Delhi on 1 May 1922, gave a major share in administration and \nteaching to representatives from Colleges. For the next twenty years Delhi University was virtually the \nsum total of its small number of Colleges, St. Stephen’s, Hindu and Ramjas where History was taught \nat the Intermediate and B.A. level. It was during the long stewardship of Sir Maurice Gwyer, Vice \nChancellor from 1939-1950 that the University started assuming something of its present shape. The \nDelhi University Act was amended to provide a three year Honours degree, Professorial Chairs were \ninstituted in Economics, History, Physics and Chemistry, most M.A. teaching was shifted to the \nDepartments.  \n \nThe Department of History and Economics were the two basic social science departments that date \nback to the late 1930s. The first holder of the Chair in History was Ishtiaq Husain Qureshi, the \ndistinguished historian of Medieval History, who moved from St. Stephen’s College to preside over the \nUniversity Department, while also holding the position of Dean of the Faculty of Arts. The late 1940s \nsaw scholars like Bisheshar Prasad (Modern History) and Parmatma Saran, the well-known historian of \nthe 13-15th centuries who joined the department after obtaining a Ph.D from the University of London. \nThe early 1950s saw the beginning of the practice of the Department inviting distinguished teachers \nfrom the University’s constituent Colleges to lecture for post-graduate classes. Notable among these \nwas K.M. Ashraf (Kirori Mal College) major scholar of social history of Medieval India and \nMohammad Amin (St. Stephen’s College) who regularly taught the history of 16-18 century India from \nc. 1949-1990. \n \nThe major event in the Department of the early 1960s was the induction of Romila Thapar, who moved \nfrom Rohtak University to Delhi University (c. 1964-1972) , and who emerged as one of the major \nhistorians of Ancient India, before shifting to JNU. The next big expansion of the Department took \nplace in the 1960s and early 1970s, when scholars of the stature of B.B. Misra (Modern History), K.S. \nLal (Medieval History 1963-1973), R.S. Sharma (Ancient India) Parthasarathi Gupta (History of \nEngland and Europe) and Sumit Sarkar (Modern India) moved from Patna, Allahabad and Kolkata to \nstrengthen the teaching and research in History. Other scholars were also inducted through this period \n– R.L. Shukla, D.N. Jha, Dilip Chakrabarti, K.M. Shrimali, Suhash Chakravarty, Aparna Basu, D. \nDevahuti. In the 1980s there was a further expansion of the Department, historians of the stature of \nGyanendra Pandey and Shahid Amin joined our ranks. Recently, prominent scholars such as Vankat \nSubramianiam, Basudev Chatterji, Kesavan Veluthat, Nayanjot Lahiri, Upinder Singh, R.C. Thakran, \nArup Banerjee and Anshu Malhotra have retired. We had the sad loss of Dr. Biswamoy Pati, a prolific \nscholar of international repute, and dearly loved by colleagues and student. An account of the recent \nprofile of our Department would be incomplete without due recognition of our College Departments, \nwhere scholarship and careful pedagogy continue to be celebrated. The names of scholars and teachers \nsuch as Uma Chakravarty, P.S. Dwivedi, Harbans Mukhia, Dilip Simeon, D.E.U. Baker, Saleem \nKidwai, Chitra Joshi, Tanika Sarkar, Shivshankar Menon, Vijay Singh, Tripta Wahi, Anil Sethi, Sumit \nGuha, Manoj Sinha, Indrani Chatterjee, Kumkum Roy, Partho Datta, G. Arunima, V.K. Jain, Rana \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n4 \n \nBehl and Firdos Anwar amongst so many others, too long a list to recount comprehensively here, is \nlegendary. And our students who graduated to teach in some of the most powerful academic \ninstitutions in the world, whose love for the discipline went so far as to claim Professor Randhir Singh \nof the Department of Political Science as one of their own! \n \nMajor revisions in the syllabi took place in the early 1970s and again in the 1980s when the teaching of \nareas other than India (Europe, China, Japan in terms of areas) and newer courses on Political Thought, \nSocial History, peasant studies were framed and scholarship strengthened. It needs stressing that the \nquality of post-graduate teaching in History for which our Department was known, depended crucially \non a very strong base that newer, redesigned courses and  first rate teaching that was imparted in our \nnumerous undergraduate Colleges. It was this symbiosis between a strong basic training in History and \nthe inculcation of a research oriented graduate studies that won our students international recognition, \nas evident from the admission of our alumni for advanced research and teaching in the leading \nUniversities in UK and the USA. \n \nOne of the outstanding features of the Department of History has always been its scholastic plurality – \nits faculty members have received their academic training around the globe, they have all written \ndiffering kinds of histories and follow their own political commitments. Although the faculty does not \nconform to a particular research methodology, this plurality in academic interests is sustained and \nreproduced through debate and discussions which we pursue through well-ingrained democratic \nimpulses. We are the richer in the range of our courses, and sharper in debate and political \ncommitments from the need to locate our intellectual positions cogently and respectful of plurality. All \nthis, even when we argue passionately and vehemently. \n \nThe Department of History is now a UGC sponsored ‘Centre of Advanced Studies’. Never has a \nbureaucratic appellation resided more comfortably as a signature of our past and our aspirations. This \nis a centre of learning, of reproduction of knowledge and debate and in foregrounding History we have \nalways been aware of the multiplicity amongst our students to whom we owe the responsibility of \nproviding the finest possible programme in the teaching and learning of our discipline. This document, \nthe Post Graduate curricula of courses, has been crafted keeping many of our past commitments to the \ndiscipline and its practitioners in mind. \n \nDepartment Highlights: \n \nThe Department of History has gained a global reputation for its intellectual contributions to the \ndiscipline. At different junctures in the past its members heralded scholarship in the field of socio-\neconomic history of a Marxist persuasion and this impacted the field of ancient, medieval and modern \nhistory. Over the years this scholarship was considerably nuanced, again by the Department’s faculty \nmembers, and it is their work, once again, that has impacted the global academy in fields such as \narchaeology, numismatics, the study of religion, gender, sexuality, processes of acculturation and \nsocial formations, social and cultural history, the study of subalterns, tribes, peasantry, labour, \neconomic history, agrarian studies, trans-regional and global studies, war, archives, language, \nliterature, translations, printing, caste, law, intellectual history, state formations, border studies, \neducation, medicine, art, cinema, merchants and litterateurs. It is a long list but the substance in the \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n5 \n \nclaim for global reputation and impact comes from the international reach of our faculty – they are on \nthe governing body of many renowned institutions in India, editors of peer-reviewed journals in the \nfield, key note speakers, panel discussants, paper presenters at conferences and workshops. Our faculty \nmembers have held visiting teaching positions in Universities across the world. Our old students hold \npositions in the History Department of nearly every major university in the world. \n \nThe Department of History is one of the leading institutions in the field in India with a huge global \nfootprint. Our international conferences and seminars host some of the world’s distinguished scholars. \nOur seminar series brings students in close proximity to scholars that they study and our ‘baithak’ \nworkshop series gives them an opportunity to question and learn how some of these scholars question, \nresearch and write. Our post graduate and research students are intrinsic participants in the organisation \nand successful conclusion of all Departmental academic activities. We hold an Annual Conference for \nResearch Students where our MA students learn how to prepare for the Research Programme and \nframe their research agendas.  \n \nIn its turn, the MA Programme is organised so that fresh undergraduates can expand their interests in \nHistory and learn how to become historians in their own right. This is detailed in the following section \n \nAbout the programme: \n \nThe M.A. History Programme has grown in the number of courses that it offers, the number of options \navailable to students, the type of pedagogy that we impart and evaluative interactions with our \nstudents. \n \nThe expansion in our courses reflects the new discipline of history where its association with the state \nand hegemonic power structures are no longer the major subjects of instruction. While we are still \ninterested in state formations the enlarged understanding of politics to fields of power relations has \nmeant that social, cultural, literary, religion, art and architectural fields are present with varying \ndegrees of emphasis in these and all courses. Our courses are organised chronologically and \nthematically. This has the advantage of looking at aspects of human experience through new \nchronologies, opening up the historiographical space to questions that are epistemological and \nchallenging to the ways in which the discipline of history has been conceptualised over time. \n \nTo underline this aspect of training, students are required to take Two Core Courses at the beginning \nand end of the MA programme. The first course eases all students into the larger conceptual milieu of \nthe discipline – the major historiographical interventions in the discipline. Different segments of the \ncourse introduces students to specific methodologies and their variations, like Marxism or the Annales; \nparticular rubrics chart out developments within the discipline in fields like economic, archaeoogical or \nintellectual history; other rubrics highlight specific kinds of historiographical interventions of import \nlike the study of early Modernities or history and literature. The second course sums up the second year \nof MA instruction by leading students through some of the major historians writing on Ancient, \nMedieval and Modern History. Many of these readings might have been partially referenced in the \nElective courses; in this course it is the historians methodological intent, their research and arguments \nthat is the subject of study. The readings are divided thematically and a range of readings on Indian \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n6 \n \nHistory are taught keeping in mind the research interests of students. We see this course as a final \ncompletion of the Masters programme. Scheduled for the fourth semester it removes ambiguities, \nprovides the summa of scholarship that a Post Graduate student must possess at graduation.  \n \nWe have identified five Open Elective papers from which two Open Elective Courses will be offered \nto students from other disciplines each academic year. These papers range in interest and time and give \nstudents from other disciplines an insight into ways in which historians research and ask questions. \nBecause of strained resources and extremely large classes the History Department has had to regulate \nthe possible number of students from other departments who can take these courses. At present eight \n(8) students from other departments can take ‘Open Elective’ Courses in the Department of History. \nNo more than four (4) students from other department can opt for any one of the two Open Elective \nPapers. To take these Open Elective Papers, students should register with the Department and if they \nwish to take two courses, then they should provide a list with their order of preference. Students will be \nselected in order of merit based upon their BA results. We want students to get the courses of their \nchoice and want to be fair and transparent since seats will be limited. \n \nThe largest numbers of courses in the MA Programme are Elective courses. In MA Part I (MA \nPrevious) we have Thirty-Two (32) Elective Papers from which a selected number will be offered \neach semester in the North and South Campus of Delhi University. Students of MA Part I are required \nto choose seven courses each academic year from this list – three (3) in Semester 1 and four (4) in \nSemester 2. Unique to the Department’s long history and one of its strengths are the courses on non-\nIndian History that we offer to entering students in MA Part I. The comparative mode of teaching \nhistory is the most effective since it teaches students how scholars have questioned archives and \nsources of other cultures and societies. This opens them to the practice of History as a global \ndiscipline. It broadens horizons teaches them how to study the unfamiliar and makes them sensitive to \nthe unique aspects of the South Asian experience which they study in the next year. This training \nprovides students with the questions and the analytical rigour to contextualise their readings on Indian \nHistory. Students often make the mistake of assuming that they have a familiarity with that which is \n‘Indian’ forgetting that their own past is a subject that has to be studied with rigour and analytical \nacuteness. The choices we provide are important because we want students to appreciate the vastness \nof the discipline today, give them the opportunity to expand their range of interests so that they are \nbetter skilled in their future endeavours. In MA Part II (MA Final) we stream students according to \ntheir preferred specialisation in Ancient, Medieval and Modern Histories. We offer fifteen (15) courses \nin Ancient History; twenty-two (22) courses in Medieval History; and twenty-seven (27) courses in \nModern History. Not all of these courses are taught every academic year but enough are offered to give \nstudents sufficient choice. Students are required to take seven (7) Elective Courses from the many that \nare taught each year – four (4) courses in the third semester and three (3) in the fourth semester.  \n \nAbout Post Graduate Attributes: \n \nOn completion of their Post Graduate courses students are expected to have acquired the skills of \ncritical thinking, rational enquiry, effective communication, comprehensive knowledge of the \nhistoriographical debates on the study of different aspects of human society and knowledge of the \narchives used by different historians in their research. The attributes expected from the graduates of the \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n7 \n \nM.A. History Programme are the following:  \n \n1) Ability to track the critical genealogies of historiographical interventions that shaped the discipline \nof History from the earliest times up to the present.  \n2) Ability to compare and differentiate significant patterns of human experience across time and \nbetween different cultures and societies.  \n3) Ability to carefully read a complex historical narrative, evaluate its deployment of evidence, and \nunderstand its argument as well as critically analyse the same \n4) Ability to identify patterns of change and continuity with regards to issues of contemporary \nsignificance over long durations as well as across diverse geo-cultural zones \n5) Ability to understand teleology and anachronism and the ways in which they can hamper historical \nanalysis \n6) Greater ability to distinguish between that which is historical -- time-place-context driven, hence \nchangeable and challengeable -- from that which is not. \n7) Recognise the different registers within language systems and sources and understand the \nsignificance of their presence in literary, art and audio materials. \n8) Possess the ability to understand that history and power are cognates and hence the silences in \nsources are just as revelatory as the documented evidence. \n9) Display sensitivity to gender and social inequities as well as acquaintance with the historical \ntrajectories of these issues \n10) Possess greater respect for basic human values and ideals of equality, freedom, respect for \ndiversity, and other constitutional values \n11) Possess skills of the academy in using information from varied sources, displaying analytical \nability, knowledge of context and ability to marshal evidence into a coherent argument.  \n12) Ability to assume responsible public roles and where they can apply the above mentioned \nanalytical abilities in other non-familiar contexts. \n13) Possess knowledge of the values and beliefs of multiple cultures so as to effectively engage in a \nmulti cultural society and interact with diverse groups.  \n14) Possess the knowledge of the academy and its demands for referencing and display of independent \nreasoning. \n15) Know the dangers of plagiarism. \n \nAbout the process of course development involving various stakeholders at \ndifferent stages: \n \nThe development of the History MA Programme was a long process. We were very sensitive \nto the past history of course revisions in the Department, and sensitive to how the discipline \nand training in it has changed over time. We kept in mind our current faculty strength, the \npossibilities of future growth and student-teacher ratios that would allow for interactive \nteaching. Most of all we wanted to be sure that our courses and their organisation could allow \nus the opportunity to monitor the progress of our students. Different kinds of assignments, \ntutorial discussions, audio and cinematic presentations, field work to archaeological and \nmonumental sites and museums were regarded as critical in the training of students. There \nwere long discussions in the Department Council and within its subcommittees regarding the \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n8 \n \nframing of Core and Elective courses. Drafts of possible options were circulated and debated. \nAt the conclusion of a the first draft of courses in 2018, we solicited feedback from \ninternational scholars. The useful recommendations of the Standing Committee last year, \ncommenced another round of discussions in the Department Council and its subcommittees. \nMany drafts of possible options were circulated leading up to the preparation of the final \ndrafts. This revised syllabus was sent to a different body of international and national stake \nholders, alumni and ex-teachers. The final version of the MA History Programme submitted \nto the Academic Council is the result of more than a year’s discussion, drafting and revisions \non the basis of all these inputs over this period of time. \n \nII.",

    "header": "III. Programme Details:",
    "text": "The two year Masters Programme in History provides specialised training to students in world \nHistory and Indian History. The course builds upon the training that students have received in \ntheir B.A. The elementary objective of this training is consolidating their skills with more \ncomplex content. Hence the M.A. curriculum and pedagogy are framed with the aim to draw \nstudents into a discussion of the reasons why and how newer questions are posed by historians, \nhow the methodology of engaging with the older questions have changed and what this learning \nreveals about the craft of historiography itself.  \n \nThe primary objectives of the MA History are therefore many – a chance to learn how \nhistorians think, research, analyse and frame their research. The focus on World History in the \nfirst year is useful since these historiographies are remote from the experience of most students. \nThey learn about other societies and cultures and the ways in which scholars have interrogated \ntheir sources, and challenged, fine-tuned or built upon each other’s research methods and \nconclusions. More critically, with the emphasis on learning research methods, students discover \na range of ways in which the human experiences in differing locales and contexts could be \nmade to speak to the ‘realities’ of past and present in their own immediate environs.  \n \nSince the second year MA courses are more specialised students hone the skills gained in their \nfirst year in closer proximity to the sources and their readings on the ancient, medieval and \nmodern periods of Indian history. The objective of these courses is to introduce and train \nstudents on how sources were/could be used by different scholars. The larger number of courses \nare thematically framed around specific subjects, regions or events. Their detailed nature \nforegrounds the materials upon which questions and narratives are raised.  \n \nThe training deals with the question not just of ‘what happened’ but  also how we know what \nhappened, how a change in perspective, emphasis and/or method might play a role in \ndetermining the shape and thrust of historical knowledge, and how concerns of our present \nmight influence the narrative of our past.. The purpose is to make the students read, describe, \nengage with and question diverse historiographies with a focus on appreciating how arguments \nare framed in all their complexities. A large number of thematic courses are designed with a \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n10 \n \nview to invite students to observe and analyse how human experiences of the same set of \ninjunctions and institutions in the past could differ due to class, status, gender, race, region, \noccupation, etc. Thus the MA programme encourages the students to understand but also go \nbeyond ‘causation’ and other standard questions in history. It invites them to read and reflect on \nthe issue of how to read sources but also on the relationships between historical facts and truths. \nThe idea is to draw attention to the thick and multiple dimensions of the experience that enfold \nthem. How may the historians discover the language and method to articulate this complexity in \nmeaningful ways? More critically, with the emphasis on learning research methods, students \ndiscover a range of ways in which the human experiences in differing locales and contexts \ncould be made to speak to the ‘realities’ of past and present in their own immediate environs.  \n \nThe objective of the diverse range of courses, readings and different kinds of assignments is to \nunderline that learning is not transacted only orally. Especially in the domain of history, the \nobjective is to train students how historians pose questions, read and marshal their evidence, \nand transcribe it into a cogent argument. The familiarity of the normal is constantly the subject \nof reflection and it is here that the requirement to read and write meaningfully extends materials \ndiscussed in class lectures. The internal evaluations that are an integral part of the MA \ncurriculum place a strong emphasis upon research based writing and oral presentations. The \nfoundations for many future research projects have their incipient formulations in these \nassignments.  \n \nProgramme Structure: \n \nThe MA History programme is a two-year course divided into four-semester. A student is \nrequired to complete 80 credits for the completion of course and the award of degree. \n \nSemester \nSemester \nPart – I \nFirst Year \nSemester I \nSemester II \nPart – II \nSecond Year \nSemester III \nSemester IV \nCourse Credit Scheme \n \nSemester \nCore Courses \nElective Courses \nOpen Elective Courses \n \nTotal \nCredits \nNo. of \nPapers \nCredits \n(L & \nT) \nTotal \nCredits \nNo. of \nPapers \nCredits \n(L & \nT) \nTotal \nCredits \nNo. of \nPapers \nCredits \n(L & \nT) \nTotal \nCredits \nI \n1 \n5 \n5 \n3 \n5 \n15 \n \n \n \n20 \nII \n \n \n \n4 \n5 \n20 \n \n \n \n20 \nIII \n \n \n \n4 \n5 \n20 \n1 \n4 \n4 \n20+4 \nIV \n1 \n5 \n5 \n3 \n5 \n15 \n1 \n4 \n4 \n20+4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* For each Core and Elective Course there will be 4 lecture hours of teaching per week. \n* Open Electives to the maximum total of 8 credits. \n* Duration of examination of each paper shall be 3 hours. \n* Each paper will be of 100 marks out of which 70 marks shall be allocated for semester \nexamination and 30 marks for internal assessment. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n11",

At least five (5) of the seven (7) Elective Courses that they are required to \ntake have to be within the periods of their specialisation. The other two courses can be from \nanother period but they can opt for only one course in each of the two semesters. For example, \na student specialising in Ancient History can take one course (out of the two permitted) from \neither the Modern or the Medieval stream in each of the two semesters 3 and 4.

    "text": "Department of History, University of  Delhi \n \n22 \n \nHSM-01 – Core Course \nThe Practice of History \n \nCourse Objectives:  \n \nThis Core Paper aims to introduce students to important issues related to historical method by \ngiving them a broad overview of significant, including recent, historiographical trends. The aim \nis to acquaint students with important historiographical interventions and issues related to the \nhistorian’s craft. This course is taught in the first semester and provides the basic foundations in \nthe practice of history that will be manifest in different ways through all the papers in the MA \nHistory programme. This course is team taught and seven themes will be taught each year. \n \nCourse Outcomes: \n \nBy the end of the course the student should be able to: \n Identify the major historiographical paradigms that have impacted on the writing of History. \n Distinguish between the major arguments of different types of historiographical \ninterventions. \n Identify the important contexts of  these historiographical interventions. \n Within each of these historiographies – like Marxism, gender or environmental history – the \nstudent will be able to identify the debates and shifts amongst historians. They will be able to \navoid flattening their rich complexities within rudimentary typologies of ‘schools’. \n Learn that the simple recounting of ‘facts’ is always imbedded in particular historiographical \nnarratives, a subject to which they will be introduced in this course and further reinforced in \nthe Elective MA History papers.  \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (2 Week): Pre-modern historical traditions \nUnit 2: (2 Week): Modern historiography: documents and the archives \nUnit 3: (2 Week): Cultural history \nUnit 4: (2 Week): Marxism \nUnit 5: (2 Week): Annales \nUnit 6: (2 Week): Gender \nUnit 7: (2 Week): Archaeology \nUnit 8: (2 Week): Art and history \nUnit 9: (2 Week): The environment \nUnit 10: (2 Week): Oral history \nUnit 11: (2 Week): Intellectual history \nUnit 12: (2 Week): Connected histories: peoples regions, commodities \nUnit 13: (2 Week): Economic History \nInit 14: (2weeks): History andLiterature \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (2 Week): This unit will discuss pre-modern historical traditions, either from antiquity or \nthe Middle Ages when notions of human agency, causation and time were quite different.  \nMarincola, John, (1997).

Select readings, periodic class \npresentations, and mid-term assignments will reinforce the details presented in class lectures. \nThe assignments in reading and writing will help students develop their critical abilities to \nverbalise their opinions coherently. The themes selected for discussion may include the ones \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n27 \n \nmentioned here, and may vary from year to year; more themes may be added to the list. Select \nreadings have been given here; detailed readings will also change depending on the instructors \nand will be circulated at the beginning of the course. \n \nAssessment: \n \nThere mode of evaluation of students enrolled in this course is in two parts: \n1) There will be a mid-term examination when four units of the course are completed, around the \neighth Week of the course worth 30 marks.. \n2) There will be a final semester examination of three hours. Students will be required to answer \nfour out of eight questions worth 70 marks. \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n28 \n \nHSM-NEW PAPER CORE COURSE 2 -- MA FINAL \n \nThe Practice of Historians:  \nReadings from Recent Historiographical Interventions in Indian History \n \n \nCourse Objectives:  \n \nThe objective of this Core Paper is to provide students with a firm grasp on the major \nhistoriographical interventions in Indian history through a critical, detailed reading of significant \nworks of history produced during the twentieth century. The course will be taught in the fourth \nsemester and will provide students them with a common foundation of readings that all Post \nGraduate students of History are expected to have mastered by the conclusion of the MA \nProgramme. The course will be team-taught, each instructor selecting a body of readings which \nthey will teach. The books included in the suggested reading list provide a general guide of the \ntexts that teachers will use but it is not exhaustive. The readings have also not be segregated \naccording to themes since many of these books are wide-ranging and can be placed under \nmultiple rubrics. Teachers will have the initiative to frame the readings under each rubric. In the \n14 weeks of instruction, approximately 14-21 books would be taught.  \n \nCourse Outcomes: \n \nBy the end of the course the student should be able to: \n Identify the major historians whose work has had a significant impact on the writing of \nIndian History. \n Distinguish between the major arguments of these historians. \n Identify the important historiographical concerns of these historians and contextualise them \nwithin large global trends in the academy.  \n Identify how different historians have contributed to the narratives that comprise Indian \nhistory.  \n Be able to identify how different historians used their sources – sometimes the same range of \nsources but with contrasting epistemologies and conclusions. \n Explain the relationship between History and Historiography \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (3 weeks): Political Histories \nUnit 2: (3 weeks): Social Histories \nUnit 3: (3 weeks): Economic histories \nUnit 4: (3 weeks): Ideologies and Cultural practices \nUnit 5: (2 weeks): Religion, religious practices and religious organisation \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: 3 weeks): This unit will discuss the writing of conventional political histories in the \nnineteenth century and cover the later more complex understanding of politics, state formations, \ngovernance and governmentality. The readings for this unit will be selected from the suggested \nreadings below. \n \nUnit 2: (3 weeks): The teaching of Social History also started in the nineteenth century but it \nwas not a subject that was foregrounded in histories of India until the twentieth. The readings for \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n29 \n \nthis unit will be selected from the suggested readings below. \n \nUnit 3: (3 weeks): The unit will discuss Economic Histories which has a very vibrant .beginning \nsince it was an integral part of the nationalist critique of colonialism, as well as colonial \napologia. This unit will chart the shifts in its methodology from the nineteenth century to the \npresent. The readings for this unit will be selected from the suggested readings below. \n \nUnit 4: (3 weeks): Like social histories, ideologies and cultural practices have also had a very \nlong history of development and have become particular rich sites of historiographical \nintervention in the twentieth century. The readings for this unit will be selected from the \nsuggested readings below. \n \nUnit 5: (2 weeks): Religion, religious practices and religious organisation had a very early \nintellectual development, sometimes as a discipline only vaguely related to history. Through the \ntwentieth century this has become a subject of great interest to historians. \n \n \nSuggested Readings: \n \nAhmed, Manan. (2016).

It \nwill help learners appreciate the processes and complexities involved in the making of Muslim \nidentity, modes of dispersal of authority across ethnic and service classes and identify complex \ninterplay of religion and politics across thirteenth and fourteenth century. The students would be \nencouraged to read Persian texts (in translation) so that they begin to recognize the ‘voice of the \nauthor’ and are trained to understand historiographical interventions that inflect the history writing \nof this time period. \n \n \nAssessment:  \n \nStudents enrolled in this course will be evaluated according to two modes: \n1) Students will have to submit a paper of circa 15-20 pages (inclusive of bibliographic apparatus) on a \ntheme designed with the help of the instructor. The term paper requires students to use source \nmaterial(s) in translation to research a subject of their choice. Ideally the subject they choose to write \nabout should not be derived from one of the historians read in this course; it should follow themes that \nare of interest to them in their personal life. Term papers will build upon aspects of social and cultural \nlife that concern students and as they develop them they would be asked to explore two related but \ndifferent aspects: a) how medieval taxonomies mean reorienting the modern assumptions of students \nand b) learn how the political suffuses different dimensions of the social and the cultural. Students are \nexpected to meet with the instructor to develop and finalise subjects and materials on which their \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n51 \n \npapers would be based. This essay will be marked out of 25 marks.  \n2) There will be an end of term semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire course. \nThe examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer 4 out of 8 \nquestions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n52 \n \nHSM-New Course \nOpen Elective 4 \nFORMS OF POPULAR RESISTANCE IN NORTHERN INDIA, c. 1560-1740 \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThe course introduces students to the varied forms of protest movements and rebellions that \nsurfaced in the political landscape of North India from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-\neighteenth century.

This course challenges these interpretations and intersects with a more \nrecent historiography on “connected histories” to understand the complex relationships of \nthese cities and their respective regimes within a larger geopolitical canvass. The exchange of \ngoods, people and ideas between Asia’s emerging ‘universal’ empires reshaped continental \nnetworks leading to the creation of new connections and new forms of alterities. The course \nwill also take the “area studies” approach to understand specific structures and ideologies of \nthe respective regimes in comprehending the urban morphologies as well as the economic and \ncultural lives of the people. \n \nCourse Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, the students would \n Know the concepts, methodology and problems of ‘Connected Histories’. \n Explore the ways in which polities and societies in these empires engaged with and \nproduced alternative imagined visions of interaction beyond given geographies. \n Develop understanding of how people in the past themselves understood and sought to \ninfluence patterns of long-distance interaction, and of how contemporaries drew \ncomparisons between widely-separated parts of the world. \n Consequently, through the circulation and mobility of men, ideas and goods across the \ntime and space the course will instruct students on trajectories of growth, interdependent \nrelationships and the emergence of universal forms of knowledge across seemingly vast \ngeographical expanses. \n Able to synthesize the histories of three empires through trade, migration and cultural \nencounters. \n How connected history helps in locating South Asia globally during the early modern \nperiod. \n Extend scope of connected histories into the realm of language, court cultures and power. \n Be acquainted with various sources for writing connected histories. \n \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Understanding “Connected Histories”. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Sovereignity and Millennium Across the Empires. \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): The Movement of People, Circulation, and Travel Across the Empires. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n58 \n \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Exchange Networks, Trade and Empires. \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Histories of the Royal Household and the Politics of the Harem.  \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): The Diffusion of Culture and Connected Metaphors Across the Empires. \nUnit 7: (Week 13-14): Europeans in Asian Empires, accounts of the encounters. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will explain the theoretical and methodological framework of \n‘Connected Histories’. \nSubrahmanyam, Sanjay.

During the course of \nthe semester, students are required to write and present two term papers. The exercise is to \nensure that students comprehend the readings and develop writing and verbal communication \nskills.  \n \nAssessment: \n \nThere will be two modes of evaluating students enrolled in this course: \n1) The two term papers, 12-15 pages each, along with the presentations, will be marked out of 25 \nmarks.  \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n67 \n \n2) There will be an end semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire course. \nThe examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer four out of \neight questions.

Using examples from around the world, we will think \nabout how societies produce authoritative historical narratives about their pasts. How does power \noperate in the making and recording of history? Whose stories are told, whose are silenced? \nWhat constitutes authoritative historical evidence, and how do historians critically read primary \nsources?  Students will study how the ordering of colonial archival systems determined the \ncredibility of particular historical narratives even as they reflect the complicated, even uncertain \nnature of colonial knowledge and governance. We look at seminal work that has engaged with \nthe issue of the retrieval of submerged voices from the official archive. We will consider how \nempires and nations remember and represent themselves through museums, memorials and other \nspectacles. The course ends with a consideration of non-documentary archives, focusing in \nparticular, on the visual in the form of photography.  \n \nLearning Outcomes:  \n \nBy the end of the course, students will: \n Read seminal historiographical interventions on critically reading the archive.  \n Appreciate the importance of understanding the archive not as a neutral repository of data but \nas knowledge, embedded in value laden power relations.  \n Unpack the complexities of the colonial archive.  \n Understand the relationship between history and memory with a particular focus on \ninstitutions and practices of national commemoration and remembrance.  \n Understand the importance of non-documentary archives by focusing on photography as an \nexample of visual sources used by historians.  \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Reading the colonial archive \nUnit 2 ( Week 3-4): Gender and the archive \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): The archive and colonial rule \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): The archive and collective memory I: commemorations \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): The archive and collective memory II: monuments  \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Museums and History  \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Spectacle and Empire  \nUnit 8: (Week 14): On Photography \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1 (Week 1-2): This unit will study key historiographical and methodological interventions \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n69 \n \non reading the colonial archive  \nAmin, Shahid.

These readings are \ncumulative; it is therefore important that no essential reading is left out. Students will be asked to \npresent reports and participate in formal class discussions on themes and texts identified by the \ninstructor. The exercise is to ensure that students comprehend the readings and develop verbal \ncommunication skills. \n \nAssessments:  \n \nStudents who take this paper will be assessed in two modes: \n1) Students will have to submit a paper of circa 15-20 pages (inclusive of bibliographic \napparatus) on a theme designed with the help of the instructor. The term paper requires students \nto use source material(s) in translation to research a subject of their choice. Term papers will \nbuild upon aspects of historiography that concern students and as they develop them they would \nbe asked to explore two related but different aspects. Students are expected to meet with the \ninstructor to develop and finalise subjects and materials on which their papers would be based. \nThis essay will be marked out of 25 marks.  \n2) There will be an end of term semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire \ncourse. The examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer 4 out \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n97 \n \nof 8 questions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n98 \n \nHSM 10 \nVisual Cultures beyond Borders: South and Southeast Asia (to 1200 CE) \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThis objective of this course is to underline the importance of moving beyond insular histories by \ninvestigating networks of interaction between South and Southeast Asia. This course undertakes \na study of southern Asian connected histories through the lens of visual remains. Students will be \nguided to focus on the motivations and modes of communication across the Indian Ocean, \nhighlighting early cross-cultural relationships in intra-Asian contexts. The course emphasizes \nthree methodological objectives—the use of visual sources in historical interpretation, moving \nfrom insular to connected histories of art, and moving away from Euro-centric legacies by \nexamining the deep histories of intra-Asian contacts. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \n This paper will teach students about an ancient interconnected Asian world, as distinct from \ninsulated histories, that has not been deeply investigated and theorised.   \n Students usually study South Asian connections with Europe and the Mid-East. This will \ngive them new information about Intra-Asian connections during ancient times. \n Since it comes through the discipline of Art, Architecture and History, it will introduce them \nto shared ideas in the South and South East Asian region which are fascinating and extremely \nimportant.  \n The students will learn to examine and integrate visual and textual sources for a more \ncomprehensive understanding of the dynamics of exchange. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: Week 1: Introduction: Sources for the study of South & Southeast Asian encounters. \nUnit 2: Week 2-3: Historiography of interactions between South and Southeast Asia.

While teaching students about the changes within the Muslim \ncommunity it focuses upon the contexts in which transitions could be appropriated within \nrelatively stable revelatory and exegetical traditions. The material contexts in which these \ndebates concerning society and belief were located provide the larger frame of analysis for the \ncourse. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course students would be able to: \n Recount the chronology of the major political formations that impacted the history of the \nCentral Islamic Lands across 600-1300 CE. \n They would be able to contextualise these developments within larger transitions in the \nreligion of Islam and the Shari‘a from its revelation to its scholastic explorations in the ninth \nand tenth century. \n They would learn how these scholastic traditions and the politics of Empire reoriented an \nearly Arabic exclusiveness to a more inclusive Islamic orientation. \n They would learn how to consider questions relating to ideological and social multiplicities \nand adherence to scriptural traditions whose histories are sometimes obscured. \n The paper also teaches students some of the great contradictions faced by Muslim jurists – \nthe question of sovereignty and temporal authority in Islam, or the possibilities of continuing \ninterpretation of the Holy Law.  \n Debate how subjects pertaining to religion, ideology, culture are not epiphenomenal to \nmaterial structures that reproduce social formations. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2):The Arabian peninsula in the seventh century, Qur'anic revelation and the \nRashidun Caliphate. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): The Marwanid settlement and the ‘Abbasid Caliphate. \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): The expansion of the Muslim community: \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): The Evolution of the Shari‘a and establishing a new socio-political order. \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Unity in the face of political divisions – the rise of Sultanates. \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Social formations in the 9th through the 13th centuries – the city and the \ncountryside. \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Changes in the central Islamic lands with the intrusion of the Mongol-Steppe \norder. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n104 \n \nUnit 8: (Week 14): Overviews: Towards a Comparative Study: Islamdom and western \nChristendom in the 12th century. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: Most of these \nreadings are available online, see: https://sites.google.com/site/duma1centralislamiclands/ \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This Unit will consider the bedouin traditions of pre-Islamic Arabian \npeninsula, its mercantile links and larger geo-political, Semitic and Iranian contexts of the \nregion. It will also focus on the revelation of the Quran, the role of the Propher, the creation of \nthe ummah, migrations, and Sufyanid tribal political formulations. \nHodgson, Marshall G. (1974).

These readings are \ncumulative; it is therefore important that no essential reading is left out. There is a lot in this \ncourse that will be new to students – in terms of information (names, places, Arabic terms), \nconcepts (notions of authority, service, associations, knowledge, beliefs) and historiography \n(orientalism, prosopography) – and the readings will need to be carefully contextualized with the \nlectures. Hodgson’s work is a lot more than a text-book; it charts out a method on how to study \nIslamicate societies (for the meaning of the term, see Hodgson). Read  it carefully. Students will \nbe asked to present reports and participate in formal class discussions on themes and texts \nidentified by the instructor. The exercise is to ensure that students comprehend the readings and \ndevelop verbal communication skills. \n \nAssessments:  \n \nStudents enrolled in this course will be evaluated according to three modes: \n1) The first will be a class quiz worth five marks, in mid-September. This will consider the new \nArabic vocabulary that was taught in the first 6-8 Week of the course. Students will be asked to \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n109 \n \nexplain the meaning of the terms and their historical significance. The quiz will ask for the \nmeanings of 10 terms/names and will be out of 5 marks. \n2) The second will be a ‘take home’ essay on one specified question (no choices) immediately \nafter the mid-term break, worth twenty marks. Students will have 48 hours to write their essay of \n1500 words (there will be negative marking for longer and shorter essays). Essays will not be \naccepted after the deadline.  This is an ‘open book’ exam, meaning that students are allowed to \nconsult their books and notes: 20 marks. \n3) There will be an end of term semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire \ncourse. The examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer 4 out \nof 8 questions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n110 \n \n \nHSM 12 \nScience, Religion and Techno-communities in Medieval Asia, 1500-1700 \n \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThe objective of the course is to introduce students to various aspects of science and technology \nin medieval Asia. The paper introduces students to how various communities in Asia engaged \nwith the idea of science, technology and medicine. This course moves away from the \nconventional Eurocentric narratives and brings into discussion the non-European societies that \nhad cultivated their own language of rational thoughts and knowledge production. The objective \nof the course is to familiarize students with developments in the field of science and technology \nin the medieval period. It will also teach them about the economic and ideological contexts \nwithin which science and technology came to be defined and understood in the non-European \nworld and before the colonial era. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would be:  \n Familiar with a number of geo-political regions that include medieval Turkey and early \nmodern China. The scientific and technological developments in these regions will be very \nuseful to make a comparative historical analysis of human thinking and knowledge \nproduction.  \n Able to understand how medieval societies perceived science and technology. \n In a position to locate the social and cultural histories of medieval period through the prism \nof ‘science’ and ‘rationality.’    \n Familiar with a variety of ‘science communities’, cutting across religion and ethnicities. \n Learn about the social and intellectual engagements with ‘distant’ communities within Asia \nand their interconnectedness and ‘familiarity’ across regions and communities.  \n Comprehension of a range of diverse readings that deal with a variety of scientific, \ntechnological and social turns in the medieval period that led to the birth of ‘modern’ science, \ntechnology, and medicine.  \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1 (Week 1-2): History of Science and Technology: A Theoretical Understanding \nUnit 2 (Week 3-4): Translation and Transition: Exchange of Ideas in the Medieval World \nUnit 3 (Week 5-6): Medicine, Hygiene and Body in Medieval Asia \nUnit 4 (Week 7-8): Privilege and Patronage: Technology and Empire Building \nUnit 5 (Week 9-10): Religion, Science and Society in Arab World \nUnit 6 (Week 11-12): Technology in the Indian Ocean: Trade, War and Power in South Asia. \nUnit 7 (Week 13): Accommodation and Assimilation: Science and Technology in Plural \nSocieties. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n111 \n \nUnit 8 (Week 14): Review Week \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit-1: (Week 1-2): This unit will introduce students to the historiography of science and \ntechnology in the Middle Ages.   \nBala, Arun.

The rise of Mongols under Chingiz Khan laid the foundations of \nthe political structures of the region, creating new structures of authority and command. In \naddition to slaughter and destruction which every Mongol raid invariably unleashed, they also \npromoted unhampered trade and commerce and ensured safety on the great silk route. The \ndiffusion of military technology and the techniques like making of paper were their ‘gift’ to the \ncivilized world. The students will have a holistic view of the Mongol phenomenon that goes \nbeyond the paradigm of brutality and annihilation of the victims. \n \nLearning Outcome: \n \nAt the end of the course the students would be: \n Familiar with the nomadic and tribal structures of the Mongols prior to the rise of Chingiz \nKhan \n Familiar with the efforts of Chingiz Khan as to how through sheer discipline and bravery he \nwas successful in creating one of the largest empires of the pre- modern times \n Understanding the weaknesses creeping the system in the urban way of life compared to the \nnomadic ways of the tribal people \n Learning about the Mongol discipline and mobilization of the combating forces as the largest \nand most mobile military unit during the pre modern times \n Learning how the Mongols, besides promoting trade and commerce, have also been a great \npatron for the liberal arts and Persian poetry.

The course will teach how gender \nenriches our understandings of history and its varied social themes, and will enable students to \nexplore linkages that have hitherto been in relative darkness. While looking at broad \nhistoriographical trends in writing gendered histories, students will be required to juxtapose these \nto trends in writing histories of gender in India. Finally, students will explore select case studies \nto highlight the connections between gender and history. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n \nUnderstand historiographical interventions in the study of gender. \n \nAppreciate the importance of studying gender as a key category of historical analysis, and \nhow ‘femininity’ and ‘masculinity’ have been culturally constructed in relation to each other \nin different societies. \n \nRealise how and why historically ‘gender roles’ have been socially conditioned. \n \nHave learnt about the ways in which in which inter-linkages between gender, nation, \nsexuality and race have been theorised and thought about by historians.  \n \nUnderstand the intersections between global gendered histories and their meanings for \nwriting history in India. \n \nThrough concrete contexts and case studies, understand how gender brings new dimensions \nto our understanding of history. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Gender in and as History \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Gender in Indian History \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): Gender, Nation and Nationalism \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Sexualities: Reading Foundational Texts \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Sexualities and Indian History \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Gender, Race and Racism: Black Feminism \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Renaissance and Gender \nUnit 8 (Week 14): Women in Nazi Germany \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n142 \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will cover methodological and theoretical questions regarding the \nrelationship between gender and history. \nBock, Gisela.

The paper covers general concepts in environmental history, and \nexplores human, non-human actors (including climate and topography), and science and \ntechnology as agents in history. In more specialized ways it requires students to interrogate the \nchanging relationship between humans and nature through more global categories of Columbian \nexchange, migration (including human, animals, plants and disease), colonialism, imperialism \nand warfare technologies. By exploring transformation of landscapes, rivers and forests, the \nobjective is to make students understand the major turning points in environmental history. \nWhile doing so the course also examines the role of governments and states in shaping the \nmodern environment around the world. The reading material for the course places environmental \nhistory in global perspective. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAfter completing this course, students would be able to – \n Know about the complexities of a ‘general’ history of environment on a transnational scale \n Learn to engage with questions on the changing relationship between humans and nature \n Understand how human-nature relations spans different times and spaces \n Comprehend the role human and non-human actors play as agents in history \n Locate the transformations of landscape, rivers and forests in various parts of the globe \n Examine the role of governments and states in shaping the modern environment \n \nCourse Contents: \n \nUnit1: (Week 1): Emerging field of Global Environmental History \na.

It aims to \nexplore the consequences of colonial intervention, the colonization of the Cape region, focussing \non the period during which it was under the Dutch East India Company, and the subsequent \nascendancy, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, of the British in the region. The \nimpact of Dutch and British colonialism in South Africa, on African societies, leading to the \nsubjugation by the last quarter of the nineteenth century of their polities constitutes a major \ntheme of the course. It seeks to enable students to understand some of the problems of \nhistoriography, influenced as it was for much of the twentieth century by racism, reinforced by \nthe ideology of the apartheid state, and which began to be contested in the last quarter of the \ntwentieth century. The ways in which colonialism was intertwined with racism is an important \nissue of interest for this course. The student would be able to understand the linkages between \nextractive industries, imperialism and racial segregation while studying this course, and \nappreciate the nature of the long and difficult struggle against racism in South Africa. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would be: \n \nAcquainted with the long-term impact of institutionalized racism, reinforced by the \nideology of the apartheid state, on the writing of histories of modern South Africa. \n \nFamiliar with the historical processes whereby colonialism, Dutch and British, subjugated \nthe people of South Africa, dislocating Black African societies. \n \nComprehend the connections between colonialism, gold mining, search for cheap labour, \nand racial discrimination, which in turn laid the foundations of the apartheid state that came in to \nexistence in 1948. \n \nGrasp the implications that ideas of race had for the non-white people of South Africa, \nand the manner in which these ideas led to extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation. \n \nUnderstand the contradictions between Afrikaners and British imperialism, and the \narticulation of Afrikaner nationalist identity in which the Afrikaans language was accorded a \nspecial place. \n \nAppreciate the significance of resistance against racial discrimination, and the difficult \nstruggle against racist policies in which during the formative phase Mahatma Gandhi played a \ncrucial role. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n188 \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Introduction to the course and discussion on the problems of racist \nhistoriography on modern South Africa. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Early European presence in the Cape, c. 1650-1800; the Khoi-Khoi and San \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): British colonial governance in the Cape; the ‘Great Trek’; colonial \nexpansion  \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Zulu and Xhosa societies; subjugation of African polities  \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Articulation of Afrikaner identity; evolution of Afrikaans; Afrikaner-\nBritish tensions \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Rise of extractive industries; South African Wars; British colonialism to \n1902 \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Formation of Union; racism, politics and society, 1910-1948 \nUnit 8 (Week 14): Resistance: role of Mahatma Gandhi; African National Congress, and other \norganizations \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will introduce the course and discuss the problems of racist \nhistoriography, of the apartheid era, on modern South Africa \nThompson, Leonard (2001), A History of South Africa, third edition, New Haven: Yale \nUniversity Press, (Preface, and Chapter 1). \nSaunders, Christopher (1988), The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians \non Race and Class, Cape Town: David Philips, especially chapters 12-18. \nHetherington, Penelope (1993), ‘Women in South Africa: The Historiography in English’ \nThe International Journal of African Historical Studies, 1993 \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/219546. \n \nUnit 2 (Week 3-4): This unit will examine early European presence in the Cape, c. 1650-1800, \nfocussing on Dutch colonialism, and look at the disruption of  Khoi-Khoi and San societies \nThompson, Leonard (2001), A History of South Africa, New Haven: Yale University \nPress, (chapter 2). \nRoss, Robert (1999), A Concise History of South Africa.

These readings are \ncumulative; it is therefore important that no essential reading is left out. Students are expected to \nregularly spend some time every Week to consult readings in libraries accessible to postgraduate \nstudents. They would also be required to engage in dialogue in the class on themes being \ndiscussed by the instructor. The exercise is to ensure that students comprehend the readings and \ndevelop verbal communication skills. They would also be encouraged to consult relevant \nmaterial available online, for which the department provides computer facilities. Students are \nencouraged to consult political maps of southern Africa, which are also used for teaching in the \nclassroom. \n \nAssessments:  \n \nThere are two modes of assessing students enrolled in this course. \n1) There will be an internal assessment exam held in mid-semester. This will be out of 25 marks. \nThis will consist of two parts: i) one essay on a topic to be selected from 2 or 3 topics given \nbeforehand to the students;  and ii) brief and precise notes or comments on some selected issues \ndiscussed in class, which will allow evaluation of regularity and comprehension in the \nclassroom, and ability to write succinctly.  \n2) There will be an end of term semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire \ncourse. The examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer 4 out \nof 8 questions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n192 \n \n \n \nHSM-40 \nImperialism and Nationalism, c.1850-1964 \n \nCourse Objectives:  \n \nThis course studies the theoretical literature that analysed the processes of imperialism in \ndifferent areas of the world. To this end it considers Marxist as well non-Marxist explanations. \nThe students in this course would stand informed about epistemological issues involved in the \nprocesses of colonisation of a large part of the world. They would also have engaged with \ndiverse historiographic perspectives on these issues both from the colonised and the European \npartS of the world. Discussion of the origins of nationalism in the nineteenth century and its \nevolution in the twentieth century will provide a thorough grounding in the central concepts and \nmajor theories of nationalism to give students a comprehensive view of the ideas of key issues. \nThe course will convey the need to understand nationalism in the context of long-term, historical \nsocial change. Identifying the major characteristics evident in the way imperialism was manifest \nin select colonies with a specific review of the Indian subcontinent is also an objective. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n Learn about the histories of imperialism and nationalism during the period between 1850 and \n1964 in considerable theoretical and empirical variations. \n Discover that how the colonial processes of social and economic change could feed into the \nmaking of an Imperialist regime and vice versa would be known to them from a variety of \nperspectives. \n Have a better understanding of the impact of European imperialism on global history, which \nshould, in turn, provide them with some historical context for understanding the contemporary \nworld. \n Appreciate the nature of the major nationalist resistance movements towards the \ndecolonization of the global south. \n Simultaneous engagement with theoretical and historical perspectives would enrich their skills \nin deploying varied ideas in reconstructing histories of themes and areas that might not be \ndirectly related to the ones discussed here. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Definitions and problems of the categories of ‘imperialism’ and \n‘Nationalism’ in a conceptual and historical perspective. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Theories of imperialism arising from Marxist-historical materialist \ntraditions. \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): Non-Marxist theories and explanations of imperialism. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n193 \n \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Imperialism in the late nineteenth century; Cultural politics of knowledge \nand imperialist rivalries; ‘scramble for Africa’. \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Understandings of nation, nationalism; nation-state. \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Protest movements against imperialism; crystallization of protests into \nanti-colonial/nationalist movements. \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Colonialism and nationalism in India: historiography; ideas about the nation; \nnational movement. \nUnit 8: (Week 14): Changing forms of imperialism in the twentieth century and beyond. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT BASED TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will examine the concepts and theories of Imperialism to interpret \nthem in the global & national contexts. \nBurbank, Jane, and Frederick Cooper.

Units 2 - 11 of the \ncourse are organized chronologically starting from the 16th to the 20th century; but Units 12 - 15 \nare organized more thematically  (Capital & the City) while retaining some chronological sense \nwithin individual themes.  \n \nAssessments:  \n \nThere will be two modes of assessing students enrolled in this course: \n1) For the purpose of Internal Assessment (carrying 25 marks), students are encouraged to write \na term paper on a topic of their choice that has either comparative perspective or global approach \nto a specific theme. Alternatively, students will be given a set of readings consisting of both \nprimary and secondary sources. They will be asked to identify some researchable questions and \nprepare an essay of about 2000 – 3000 words with the help of the resources provided by the \ncourse teacher. Students are required to have verbal presentation of their written assignment in \nsmall groups of their own formation.  \n2) End-semester examination of three-hour duration will assess the student’s understanding of \nthe prescribed syllabus and this will be marked out of 75 marks. In the current format, students \nare expected to answer four out of eight questions.   \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n206 \n \n \nHSM New Course- \nHistories of Modern Sexualities and Masculinities \n \nCourse Objective: \n \nThe objective of the course is to teach students histories of modern sexualities and masculinities, \nwhich have emerged as a critical component for understanding gender histories of different \nsocieties and cultures. Students will be taught diverse themes and concepts on the historical \nconstructions of sexualities and masculinties in the modern world, which will be justaposed and \ncompared to modern Indian histories. The course will be thematic rather than chronological, and \nwill examine broad debates and theoretical formations around sexualities and masculinities. \nStudents will study some pioneering works, which have moulded the ways in which we examine \nthese issues in historical contexts, both in the world and in India. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n Understand histories of sexualities and masculinities. \n Realise the significance of recovering lost or ignored histories and experiences, and in \ninventing and reinventing gender history.  \n Appreciate ways of writing about sexuality, masculinity, gender and the body in a historical \nframework.  \n Know that sexualities and masculinities are not stable concepts but shift over time and space, \nand acquire distinct meanings in different societies.  \n Grasp meanings of hegemonic and subordinate masculinities. \n Be able to juxtapose historical evolution of sexualities and masculinities with debates and \nquestions on it in an Indian context. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Sexual Identities and History: Reading Foundational Texts \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Regulation of Sexualities Since 1800 \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): Understanding Masculinities Historically \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Colonialism, Nationalism, Sexualities and Masculinities in India \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Hegemonic Masculinities and Violence \nUnit 6: (Week 11): Subordinate Masculinities: Race, Caste, Class and Religion \nUnit 7: (Week 12): Same Sex Relations: Queer Politics and Homosexuality \nUnit 8 (Week 13-14): Historical Debates on Prostitution; Visual-Cultural Representations of \nMasculinity in History \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will study some of the foundational texts and readings on histories \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n207 \n \nof sexualities. \nButler, Judith.

Moving across a \nbroad canvas from prehistoric practices in the Eastern Mediterranean and regions of West Asia, \nMesopotamia, Egypt, Classical Greece and Rome, the course will culminate with an exploration \nof the milieu in which sects within Judaism and early Christian communities existed in close \ngeographical proximity- and yet with sharply defined contours. \n \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \n \nStudents will learn how religion and ritual practices are deeply imbedded in the \ncultural, social and political history of regions and how communities’ identities have \nhistorical contexts. \n \nStudents will understand the importance of historiographical perspectives with an \ninterdisciplinary approach towards the study of religion and how cultural practices \nreflect social complexities.  \n \n Students will have experience on working on different types of sources and material \nevidence. \n \n They will be able to co-relate and work out the points of commonalities and \ndivergences between different religious and cultural practices and how they may have \ncontributed towards social diversities.  \n \n They will understand the intersections between regions, social-cultural histories and \nthe formation of regional and cultural identities. \n \nThrough the study of specific case studies, students will understand how religion and \nreligious practices bring new dimensions to our understanding of history. \n \n Reading, writing and discussion will build up comprehension and analytical skills of \nthe students. \n \n \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1(Week 1-2) Historiographical backdrop- Studies on society, religion and ritual practices.  \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n212 \n \nUnit 2 (Week 3-4) Prehistoric Beliefs, Rites and Funerary Practices-specific case studies from \nAnatolia (Turkey) and Levant (Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and West Asia).  \nUnit 3 (Week 5-6) Myths, cults and religious practices in City states of early Mesopotamia. \nUnit 4 (Week 7-8) Religious beliefs, conceptualizations relating to death and afterlife in Early \nEgyptian Society. \nUnit 5 (Week 9-10) Religion, mythology, culture and society in Classical Greece. \nUnit 6 (Week 11-12) Religious cults and ritual practices in Rome, strategies of inclusion and \nexclusion.  \nUnit 7 (Week 13) Judaism and the emergence of Christianity. \nUnit 8  (Week 14) Early monasticism and the Christian community (upto 400 C.E.). \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1 (Week 1-2).

The paper attempts to guide students to move beyond the epistemologies that framed \nexisting debates, and question afresh the different and changing social and political structures \nthat framed and contested authority in north India during the 13th – 15th centuries. Islam certainly \nwas an important aspect in the making of this world, but since it possessed so many facets and \nagencies, its many aspects related to society and politics in divergent and sometimes competing \nways. Through the study of different structures and processes that shaped the period of the Delhi \nSultanate over time, students will be introduced to the different strands that allows for a more \nintegral contextualisation of its evolving society and politics in the history of north India.  \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would be: \n Familiar with the different kinds of sources available for writing histories of various aspects \nof life during the 13 – 15th centuries \n Have a firm grasp on the politics and major events in the history of the slave, Khalaji and \nTughluq regimes. \n Learn the various historiographical interventions in the study of this period and their \nepistemological locations. \n Discover the multiple nodes of power that shaped Muslim society and the heterogenous \nnature of medieval society. \n Learn that politics and authority are an integral aspect of social and cultural life. \n Investigate how medieval taxonomies are quite different from modern ones, and learn how \nnotions of family, social networks, service, freedom/unfreedom, for instance, were quite \ndifferent in the 13-15th centuries. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1): Introduction to the course and contrasting pre-histories of the Delhi Sultanate \nUnit 2 (Week 1): The Politics of writing a history of the Delhi Sultanate \nUnit 3 (Week 2): Islam and its Ghurid-Shansabanid contexts in the 12th century \nUnit 4 (Week 3-4): The early Persian literati and narrativising the origins of the Delhi Sultanate \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n304 \n \nUnit 5 (Week 5-6): Thirteenth Century Political Culture: the Turks and the Sultan’s servants \nUnit 6 (Week 7): Sultan Raziyya and the Accounts of Men \nUnit 7 (Week 8): The Political Economy of the fourteenth century Sultanate \nUnit 8 (Week 9: Courts of a Different Order – the Sufis tariqas  \nUnit 9 (Week 10): Nizam al-Din Auliya \nUnit 10 (Week 11): Frontier Feudatories and the Khalaji and Tughluq regimes \nUnit 11 (Week 12): Sultanate Settlements, the literati and regime change \nUnit 12 (Week 13: The end of the 14th Century – Timur, the Rajputs and the Twilight of the \nSultanate? \nUnit 13 (Week 14: Contextualizing the Sultanate in the History of India \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: Most of the \nessential readings for this course are available online, see: \nhttps://sites.google.com/site/lmudelhisultanate/ \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1): This unit will cover the historiographical background of the Delhi Sultanate \nSharma, R.S.

These readings are \ncumulative; it is therefore important that no essential reading is left out. Students will be asked to \npresent reports and participate in formal class discussions on themes and texts identified by the \ninstructor. The exercise is to ensure that students comprehend the readings and develop verbal \ncommunication skills. \n \nAssessment:  \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n310 \n \n \nStudents enrolled in this course will be evaluated according to two modes: \n1) Students will have to submit a paper of circa 15-20 pages (inclusive of bibliographic \napparatus) on a theme designed with the help of the instructor. The term paper requires students \nto use source material(s) in translation to research a subject of their choice. Ideally the subject \nthey choose to write about should not be derived from one of the historians read in this course; it \nshould follow themes that are of interest to them in their personal life. Term papers will build \nupon aspects of social and cultural life that concern students and as they develop them they \nwould be asked to explore two related but different aspects: a) how medieval taxonomies mean \nreorienting the modern assumptions of students and b) learn how the political suffuses different \ndimensions of the social and the cultural. Students are expected to meet with the instructor to \ndevelop and finalise subjects and materials on which their papers would be based. This essay will \nbe marked out of 25 marks.  \n2) There will be an end of term semester examination that will cover the contents of the entire \ncourse. The examination will be of 3 hours duration and students will be required to answer 4 out \nof 8 questions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n311 \n \nHSM 352 \nHistory of North India, ca. 1400-1550 \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThis course focuses on the politics and social history of the long fifteenth century and early \nsixteenth century.

Students are expected to participate in class room discussions and \nmake short theme based presentations and brief write ups that can help them to polish their \nlanguage, communication skills and method of articulation.   \n \nAssessments:  \n \nStudents taking this paper will have their word assessed in two modes: \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n346 \n \n1) Students are asked to submit a theme based research paper (2500-3000 words) on a topic that \nthey are free to choose from the course, with the help of the teacher. This term paper is marked \nout of 25 marks.  \n2) The end of term semester examination covers the full content of this course. The examination \nwill be of 3 hours duration and students are required to answer 4 out of 8 questions. Marks will \nbe awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n347 \n \n \nHSM 358 \nForms of Resistance in Northern India, ca. 1560-1740 \n \nCourse Objectives:  \n \nThe course introduces students to the varied forms of protest movements and rebellions that \nsurfaced in the political landscape of North India from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth \ncentury. The objective of the course is to teach students  the theories and methodology of popular \nresistance as an oppositional act. Like all acts, resistance is situated in certain time, space and \nrelations, and engages with different types of actors, techniques and discourses. While  asking \nquestions about what ‘counts’ as popular resistance this course will consider how popular \nresistance is developed and deployed as a tactic for subverting, seizing and transforming power \nrelations. It underlines the divergent patterns of protest in Mughal India, ranging from ‘everyday \nforms of resistance’, to the ‘recalcitrance’ of elite service classes, revolts under the stewardship \nof sectarian leaders and armed peasant revolts. It also explores the historical and imagined \nmemory of these revolts in oral traditions and folklores.  \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, the students would: \n \nIdentify with the ‘history from below’ approach with reference to medieval India.  \n \nAppreciate how social history and voice of the marginalised can be researched by \ndifferential reading of source material. \n \nUnderstand the concept of everyday forms of resistance and the ways in which it has \ntransformed our understanding of ‘politics’, making the ordinary life of subalterns’ part of \nhistorical studies. \n \nAnalyse how such mobilizations throw epistemological challenge to disciplines that \ntraditionally focus on already identified structures of power, collective actions, or political \nprocesses. \n \nBe able to appreciate the historiographical shifts in the understanding of the popular forms of \nresistance. \n \nAble to examine and understand the early modern South Asian histories of resistance in \nterms of cultural domination and subversion. \n \nHow popular literature helps in reconstruction of the marginalized resistance. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Meanings, Historiography and sources of popular resistance, everyday and \nroutine forms of resistance. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n348 \n \nUnit 2 (Week 3-4): Peasant Revolts:  Nature of Peasant Revolts in Mughal India; Modes of \nProtest; Response of the State.  \nUnit 3 (Week 5-6): Mughal Frontiers: Protest and Resistance. \nUnit 4 (Week 7-8): Zamindars’ Revolts: Zamindar and the Mughal Administration- Local \nUprisings and their Consequences for the Mughal Polity; Nature and Power of the New \nZamindars; Revolts of Jats. \nUnit 5 (Week 9-10): Religious Forms of Resistance: Raushani Movement (1585, 1611-16, 1628 \nA.

Students will learn that this can be a surprisingly difficult exercise since sources \ndealing with Delhi are, for the large part of this period, relatively unreflective about specific \ndetails relating to the physical or the social world of the city. Students will therefore learn as \nmuch about Sultanate and Mughal Delhi as they will about how to question, research and \ncontextualise materials accessible to them in the sources much of which are available in \ntranslation.  \n \nCourse Outcomes: \n \nBy the end of the course, students will be able to: \n Establish the  chronology, the location and the features of the many Sultanate and Mughal \ncities and settlements in Delhi. \n They will be familiar with the monumental sites that survive and would have visited many of \nthem on field trips. \n They will learn about the geography of the riverine plain of Delhi and learn how to map the \ntopography and monumental remains of past regimes. \n They will access architectural and epigraphical materials and learn how to correlate these \nwith narrative, textual materials. \n Students will learn how to read space as site of social and political negotiation where \nauthority, dominance and resistance is inscribed. \n Students will be able to differentiate between different types of heritage sites – those that are \nin ruins or saved as antiquities, others that continue as sites of residence and habitation and \ncomplicate modes of transcribing them as heritage sites. \n Students will learn about the more ‘organic’ settlements of Sufi masters and their shrines that \ndotted the riverine plain of Delhi.  \n They will comprehend the difference between urbanisation and urbanity. \n They will become familiar with the lives of litterateurs and poets of the city, the merchants \nand the menials and the significance attached to civility and decorum in a city heralded as the \ncapital of powerful political formations.  \n Students will learn how to notice change in the life of the city and the different and complex \nways in which elites, literati and the common people responded to these transitions and early \nmodernity \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n396 \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Historiographical concerns – historicizing space, the city, urbanisation,  \nUnit 2: (Week 3): Studying Urbanisation in the Sultanate Context. \nUnit 3: (Week 4-5): The social and political context of Sultanate cities \nUnit 4: (Week 5-6): Monumental and conflicting claims to authority: Siri, ‘Ala al-Din Khalaji \nand Mubarak Shah Khalaji  \nUnit 5: (Week 7): Monumental and conflicting claims to authority: Field Trip to Tughluqabad. \nUnit 6:  (Week 8-9): Worship and communitarian scaffolding – the Qubbat al-Islam masjid, the \ndargah of Bakhtiyar Kaki and Nizam al-Din \nUnit 7: (Week 9): Courts of a different order: Case study of Kilukhri \nUnit 8: (Week 10): Fourteenth-fifteenth century transitions – the present and past of Firuz \nShah’s Firuzabad \nUnit 9: (Week 11): 15th and 16th century Afghan settlements and the making of the Akbarid \ndispensation  \nUnit 10: (Week 12-13): The city and Shah Jahani political order – the citadel and the city \nUnit 11: (Week 14): 17th and 18th century transitions -- political decentralisation and new \nelites.

Please use Y.D. Sharma, Delhi and its Neighbourhood, Delhi: Archaeological \nSurvey of India, several reprints, to discover a monumental site that you will visit, investigate \nand write about. You will shape your project with the assistance of the  instructor. Many readings \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n403 \n \nthat will get you started on this project are to be found at: \nhttps://sites.google.com/site/sultanatemughaldelhifieldwork/  \n \nBy the fourth week of the course students are supposed to have identified the site they wish to \ninvestigate and write upon. On the last class of the fourth week of the term they will submit a \npage long abstract on their sites and the questions they wish to raise in their paper. \n \nAssessment: \n \nStudents enrolled in this course will have two modes of assessment: \n1) They have to write a term paper, ca 5000 + words, inclusive of bibliographic apparatus, on a \nsite which they will research and evaluate. Other than researching its history they also have to \nanalyse it as a heritage site. They have to first discuss this site with the instructor. It is therefore a \ngood idea to have a choice of sites from which the one most likely to yield profitable research \noutcomes can be chosen. This essay will be for 25 marks. \n2) The end of semester examinations will cover the entire course. Students will be asked to \nrespond to four questions out of a choice of eight. The examination is three hours long and worth \n75 marks. \n \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n404 \n \nHSM 370 \nForms of Historical Writing in Medieval and Early Modern India \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThis course introduces students to the vibrant traditions of history writing in medieval and early \nmodern India.

It will \nemphasize the complex circulation, exchanges and interactions that operated across the formal \nborders of imperial formations. The exchange of goods, people and ideas between Asia’s \nemerging ‘universal’ empires reshaped continental networks leading to the creation of new \nconnections and new forms of alterities. The course will examine sources like paintings, \nportraits, architecture to understand connected histories. We shall also examine the “area studies” \napproach to understand specific structures and ideologies of the respective regimes in \ncomprehending the urban morphologies as well as the economic and cultural lives of the people.  \n \nCourse Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, the students would \n Know the concepts, methodology and problems of ‘Connected Histories’. \n Explore the ways in which polities and societies in these empires engaged with and produced \nalternative imagined visions of interaction beyond given geographies. \n Develop understanding of how people in the past themselves understood and sought to \ninfluence patterns of long-distance interaction, and of how contemporaries drew comparisons \nbetween widely-separated parts of the world. \n Consequently, through the circulation and mobility of men, ideas and goods across the time \nand space the course will instruct students on trajectories of growth, interdependent \nrelationships and the emergence of universal forms of knowledge across seemingly vast \ngeographical expanses. \n Able to synthesize the histories of three empires through trade, migration and cultural \nencounters. \n How connected history helps in locating South Asia globally during the early modern period. \n Extend scope of connected histories into the realm of language, court cultures and power. \n Be acquainted with various sources for writing connected histories. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Understanding “Connected Histories”. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Sovereignity and Millennium Across the Empires. \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): The Movement of People, Circulation, and Travel Across the Empires. \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Exchange Networks, Trade and Empires. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n422 \n \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Histories of the Royal Household and the Politics of the Harem.  \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): The Diffusion of Culture and Connected Metaphors Across the Empires. \nUnit 7: (Week 13): Connecting, comparing and contrasting public spaces and urban culture of \nthe Empires. \nUnit 8 (Week 14): Europeans in Asian Empires, accounts of the encounters. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will explain the theoretical and methodological \nframework of ‘Connected Histories’. \nSubrahmanyam, Sanjay.

Students are expected to prepare and participate in class discussions, and to give formal \npresentations so that they can develop their oratory skills and are able to understand the readings \nbetter. \n \nAssessment:  \n \nInternal Assessment will be a continuous process based on three fold approach of reading, \nunderstanding and articulation. Students enrolled in the course would have their work assessed in \nthree modes. \n1) There will be a 10 marks internal assessment exam held in mid-semester.  \n2) Students will be expected to submit a 15 marks research paper on one of the topics of the \ncourse.  \n3) There will be an end of term semester examination covering the entire course. This will be a 3 \nhours duration University examination and students will be required to answer 4 out of 8 \nquestions. Marks will be awarded out of a maximum of 75 marks. \n \n \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n427 \n \nHSM: New Course \nThe World of Merchants in Early Modern South Asia \n \nCourse Objectives: \n \nThe course will teach students about a period of the early modern world (ca 1500-1800) that \nwitnessed the rise of complex merchant networks and trade relations. The world of merchants \nwas not subject to the idea of political frontiers; they worked with state systems but their \nnetworks and interests transcended geographical and imperial boundaries. The paper gives \nhistorical agency to merchants and their communities and examines their forms of commercial \ninterconnections, the knowledge systems and their negotiations with local politics as they \nresponded to larger global movements. Merchants were important actors in the intense \ncirculation and exchange of the economic, political, social, and cultural life of early modern Asia \nand they brought societies around the world into interdependent relationships. Even as they \nresolutely defended their autonomy, they patronized cultural pluralism and regional societies, \nlanguages and literatures. They were collaborators and contestants in their search for autonomy \nas fierce adherents of tradition and pragmatic innovation. It is in these merchants and their \ncommunities that we find early-modern cosmopolitanism as well as the pursuit of local religious \nand sectarian traditions. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n Be able to appreciate trade and commerce beyond the narrow technicalities of economic \nhistory. \n Comprehend the social roots of the mercantile economy in the larger milieu. \n Appreciate the complex transactional networks the South Asian merchants constructed and \ninhabited. \n Discover how merchants and their networks helped to create an interconnected world of \nIndian Ocean and Eurasian trade. \n Be able to examine the global status of South Asian merchants in terms of their commercial \noperations and business acumen. \n Able to recognize the literary and cultural contributions of South Asian merchants during \nearly modern times. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Imagining the Early Modern Merchants and Traders. \nUnit 2 (Week 3-4): The Merchant and the State: Markets and Urbanization. \nUnit 3 (Week 5-6):Politics of Trade, Resistance and Search for Autonomy. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n428 \n \nUnit 4 (Week 7-8): Communities and Networks: Banjaras, Baniyas,Bohras, Chettiars, Jain, \nMarwari and European Merchant Groups. \nUnit 5 (Week 9-10): Maritime and DiasporaMerchants in the Indian Oceanregion and beyond. \nUnit 6 (Week 11):The Social Identities and Practices of Merchants and their Communities. \nUnit 7 (Week 12):The Merchant as Litterateur and Patron- Literary Cultures and Narratives. \nUnit 8 (Week 13-14):Case Studies:  Banarsidas and Jean Baptiste Tavernier. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit would help students to pose and resolve methodological and \ntheoretical questions in studying the histories of the South Asian merchants and traders during \nearly modern times. \nGurevich, AronJa.

It will inform the students as to why and how caste and gender are at the centre of \nhistorical writings on colonial India today, whereby studies on them have been widely \nrecognised as the most challenging and exciting interventions in the recent past in social and \ncultural histories of modern India. In historicizing various axes of gender and caste identities, the \ncourse will guide students on how these were represented and conceived through a historical and \nan interactional course. The paper will be thematic rather than chronological and will particularly \ngrapple with how these identities could be both limiting and liberating. Central to it will be the \nrole and impact of women and caste stratification on constructions of nationalism. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAfter the successful completion of this course, students will: \n Have knowledge about the making and remaking of gender and caste identities in modern \nIndia. \n Understand how gender and caste are deeply intertwined. \n Appreciate how and why gender and caste identities help us in critiquing and challenging \nsingular, neat identities.  \n Comprehend the nature of debates that were taking place between the colonisers, reforms and \nnationalists around ‘gender’ and ‘caste’ questions. \n Understand layers of discussions around ‘tradition’ and ‘modernity’. \n Be able to analyse women’s role and participation in social reforms and nationalist \nmovements. \n Have a firm grasp over caste movements that emerged in various regions of India in late \nnineteenth, early twentieth century. \n Comprehend debates between Gandhi and Ambedkar on the caste question. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): Colonial Knowledge, Caste and Census; Emerging Caste Associations \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Non Brahmin and Dalit Movements in Different Regions: Maharashtra, \nTamilnadu, Bengal, Gangetic Plains \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): Gandhi and Ambedkar on the Caste Question \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): The Gender of Caste \nUnit 5: (Week 8-9): Gendering Reforms and Nationalism: A Broad Historiography \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n458 \n \nUnit 6: (Week 9-10): Women and Social Reform Movements: Sati Debates, Age of Consent, \nWidow Remarriage, Education \nUnit 7: (Week 11-12): Women and Popular Culture \nUnit 8 (Week 13-14): Women, Nationalism and Partition \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will examine the implications of colonialism for caste and how \ncensus helped in consolidating caste identities. \nAhmad, Imtiaz.

Beginning with historicising of the space that comes to be called \nIndia’s North East, the course engages with various themes in the economy, culture and politics \nof this region such as agrarianisation, colonial forestry, migration, plantation economies, print \nculture, the advent of missionaries, the politics of nationalism and the impact of Partition. The \nassociations between political sovereignty, law, economy and culture are examined through \nconcrete illustrations from the history of the hills and the valleys. Further, the course historicises \nthe idea of the ‘tribe’ in northeastern India and locates it in the history of anthropology, race and \nempire.    \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \n The course requires students to read and analyse a collection of primary texts from the \ncolonial period through class discussions, presentations and written tutorials.  \n It introduces them to the methods of conducting historical research and encourages them to \nformulate original projects of research in the final semester of their postgraduate programme.  \n Other significant outcomes of the course include discerning critical shifts in historiographical \ntrends in writings on northeastern India.  \n The course familiarises students with the political history of northeastern India under British \nrule and into the period of Partition.  \n The focus on the history of the ‘tribe’ in India would help students understand contemporary \nethnic movements in the region.   \n A significant outcome of the course would also be a closer understanding of the history of \ncommodities such as tea, rubber, coal and oil.  \n The reading and writing assignments build the comprehension and verbal abilities of the \nstudents. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): The Politics of Space: Counter Narratives for Northeastern India \nUnit 2: (Week 3-5): The Colonial Order: Reorganising the Hills and Plains  \nUnit 3: (Week 6-8): A: The Colonial Economy I:  Land, peasants, migration, forests       \nUnit 4: (Week 9-11): The Colonial Economy II: Tea, Opium, Rubber and Jute \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n489 \n \nUnit 5: (Week 12): Print, Missionaries and Identity \nUnit 6: (Week 13-14): Nationalism, Separatism and Partition \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit studies alternate approaches to the study of the spatial history of \nnortheastern India.  \nScott, James.

It seeks to enable students to understand some of the problems that the long-term impact \nof colonial historiography has had on writings on the struggles of 1857-59, and acquaint them \nwith approaches that have more recently tried to broaden historical enquiry regarding the revolt. \nThe narrower geographical focus of questions pertaining to the revolt in much of the earlier \nscholarship has given way to a wider sweep, which in turn has led to fresh questions and \ninsights. The student would be introduced to some of the debates on the relationship between the \n‘mutinies’ in the East India Company’s army and civil rebellion, peasant resistance, and popular \nmobilization. Responses of various social classes would be analyzed, providing an opportunity to \nunderstand society, politics and the state in colonial India of the 1850s and beyond. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would be: \n \n Acquainted with problems of sources for writing histories of the revolt, particularly the \nexcessive reliance on the colonial archive due to its relative profusion. \n Familiar with character of the colonial state in the nineteenth century, with its recourse to the \nuse of violence to establish its authority. \n Comprehend the diverse historiographical approaches to the study of revolt anti-colonial \nresistance and their ideological moorings. \n Grasp the different ways in which individuals and social groups perceived colonial authority, \narticulated grievances, opposed or sided with the state or its organs, and the options available \nto empire for exercising power. \n Understand that politics and authority are inherent features of social and cultural life. \n Make sense of the processes whereby resistance and collaboration shaped colonialism during \nthe second and third quarters of the nineteenth century. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1): Introduction to the course and discussion on colonial historiography on the \nrevolt, and its impact. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n499 \n \nUnit 2 (Week 1): Alternative sources \nUnit 3 (Week 2-3): Case studies (1): Meerut–Delhi \nUnit 4 (Week 4-5): Case studies (2): Kanpur \nUnit 5 (Week 6): Case studies (3): Jhansi-Gwalior \nUnit 6 (Week 7): Reponses of i) the intelligentsia; ii) peasants; iii) landed elites \nUnit 7 (Week 8): Role of the sipahis (‘sepoys’); reasons for disaffection; mutiny \nUnit 8 (Week 9): Pan-Indian character of the revolt: Panjab; south India \nUnit 9 (Week 10): Pan-Indian character of the revolt: Eastern and north-Eastern India. \nUnit 10 (Week 11): Survey of recent trends in historiography, since c.2007 \nUnit 11 (Week 12): Survey of recent trends in historiography, continued (focus on writings on \nlower castes) \nUnit 12 (Week 13): Politics of Commemoration: Colonial memorials (Kanpur, Lucknow, the \n‘1857 tour’) \nUnit 13 (Week 14): ‘The 1857 tour’; review \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1): This unit will provide an overview of the chronology of the revolt, and \nintroduce some of the issues relating to problems of historiography on the revolt. \nSen, Surendranath (1957), Eighteen Fifty-Seven, New Delhi: Publications Division. \nJoshi, P.C.

The two key threads to \nbe pursued are (1) historical practice via the questions around epistemology and narrative; \ndifferences and continuities between the pre-modern and the modern, and (2) Historical practice \nand its relationship to collective and personal agency, and the constitution of ‘political’ \nconsciousness. Arguments from different historical traditions will be analysed to address these \nproblems.  \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n Understand the relationship between historical  consciousness and the modern discipline of \nhistory \n Understand the relationship between historical consciousness and political consciousness \n Understand the epistemological problems involved in the practice of historical writing \n Explore the relationship between different historical traditions and modern historical practice \n \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1(Weeks 1-4): History and its Modern Origins. Relationship between Modernity and the \nWest.

The artisans, including metalworkers, srnnnat\n \n, shoemakers, dyer, \nspinners, dyers, weavers, embroidery-workers, blacksmiths and even carpenters etc.- lay at the \nsocial as well as the economic heart of society. A historical overview of craft traditions from the \nearly modern to contemporary periods would be required in order to situate them in the cultures \nthat produced them within a material culture of ingrained hierarchies. The associations between \nliving practices and ritualistic forms, ceremonial occasions, customary beliefs and fashions, \ngendered work cultures becomes a part of the complex study of artisan culture. Finally, to \nillustrate and complicate the more general processes discussed in the course, students will \nexplore the history of particular artisanal traditions as select case studies -- its geographical \ndistribution, internal organization, patterns of patronage, myths and legends associated with \ndifferent influences on the artisan and so on. \n \nLearning Outcomes: \n \nAt the end of the course, students would: \n Reflect upon craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology. \n Learn about the intersections between craft, skill and science; and questions of historical \nmethodology and evidence in the reconstruction of historical experience of crafts. \n Acquire the knowledge about the history of artisanal work, as much as the sociological, \nhistorical and cultural conditions of their production, in pre –colonial and colonial India.  \n Get information about the social structures that supported certain forms of production and \nconsumption (e.g., associations such as guilds, workshops, manufactories).  \n Know about changes in the hands-on approach reshaped by technological shifts, \ninterdependent practices of making and the relationship between labour and status? \n Understand crafts as material and consumer objects and critical role of the crafts community \nand its integral relationship to the Indian history. \n \nCourse Content: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): The meaning of work and the artisanal economy. \nUnit 2: (Week 3-4): Local skill and Knowledge systems, the artisanal workplace and production \nmethods. \nDepartment of History, University of  Delhi \n \n567 \n \nUnit 3: (Week 5-6): Histories of crafts from Pre-colonial to Early-colonial India, regional \nperspectives. \nUnit 4: (Week 7-8): Artisan communities, artisan life-cycle, social hierarchies of work, \nindividual craftsmen and women. \nUnit 5: (Week 9-10): Networks of crafts distribution, consumption and fashion. \nUnit 6: (Week 11-12): Marginalization of work and Forms of identities among Artisanal groups. \nUnit 7: (Week 13: Authority and resistance: artisans in the society, economy, polity and culture. \nUnit 8 (Week 14): Artisans in the era of industrial capitalism. \n \nESSENTIAL READINGS AND UNIT WISE TEACHING OUTCOMES: \n \nUnit 1: (Week 1-2): This unit will raise and explain methodological and theoretical questions \nabout the meaning of work and the artisanal skill economy. \nAdamson Glenn (ed.)

These questions should be thematic or \nconceptual—not merely factual trivia. In lieu of a question, select a quote or aspect of the case \nthat you wish to discuss further. Reader questions or quotes must be typed and are due at the \nbeginning of class. These will be scored on a standard grading scale based on their degree of \nthoughtfulness and insightfulness based on the issues raised by the readings. As we move \nthrough the course and have more points of comparison, please ask questions that link together \nprevious readings. This will be marked out of 5 marks.  \n4) End-semester examination of three-hour duration will assess the student’s understanding of \nthe prescribed syllabus and this will be marked out of 75 marks. In the current format, students \nare expected to answer four out of eight questions.",
