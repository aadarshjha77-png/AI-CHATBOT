    "text": "The Department of Political Science is a premier seat of learning and centre of knowledge \nproduction in India. The Department provides academic leadership to the single largest fraternity \nof students, scholars and faculty doing Political Science in the country. It enjoys an exceptional \nreputation in both teaching and research in the discipline. The Department was established in \n1952, with about 40 postgraduate students. Since then the strength of the students has gone \nbeyond 800. \n \nThe growth of the Department has coincided with the progress of the discipline of Political \nScience from a narrow body of legal and institutional knowledge to more comprehensive social \nsciences discipline that integrates and interrogates sociological, economic, philosophical and \ncultural dimensions and thereby better relates to a purposive study of politics, especially keeping \nIndian realities in focus. \n \nThe Department has been granted the Centre for Advanced Studies status by University Grants \nCommission since 2005. It was first granted a Special Assistance Programme by the UGC in \n1999. On its completion in 2004, it was elevated to Centre for Advanced Studies status and \ncurrently it's in the third stage of this grant. Over the years, the Department has used this \nopportunity to do extensive new research, create new syllabi at both undergraduate and \npostgraduate levels, build an impressive Departmental library and network with a large number of \nnational and international scholars through conferences and workshops. \n \nThe Department provides a platform for a wide array of research endeavours ranging from \nnational and international projects, international collaborations, University’s CAS-SAP \nProgramme, Conferences, Seminars and Workshops both at the national and international level to \nResearch Networks/groups. The Department is undertaking extensive research in varied thrust \nareas including Globalization, Justice and Democracy; Democracy, Norms and Institutions; Social \nInclusion/Exclusion, Representation and Discriminatory Practices; Nyaya-Global Justice and \nGlobal Poverty; Cultures of Governance and Conflict Resolution; Federalism: Institutions and \nProcesses among others. \n \nThe wide ranging international collaborations of the Department highlight its continuing \nendeavours toward providing opportunities to its students and faculty to engage with fellow \nscholars across the world. Some of the Department's key international collaborations since 2010 \ninclude: Exchange by Promoting Quality Education Research and Training in South and South \nEast Asia Program (EXPERTS), U21 Teaching Program, Nyaya-Global Justice Program, \nContinuity and Change in Federalism, Role of Governance in Resolution of Socio-Economic and \nPolitical Conflict in India and Europe and System of Relatedness, Culture and Vulnerability in \nTransition: Dalit Life Worlds in Post-Liberalized India. \n \nOne of the unique features of the Department is its research networks. The Department acts as an \numbrella for numerous and varied research networks across and through disciplines and sub-\ndisciplines. Each group consists of both researchers and faculty members from the Department of \nPolitical Science and other constituent colleges of Delhi University. These groups facilitate \nsharing of research findings by organizing conferences and workshops in collaboration with \n \nDepartment of Political Science, University of Delhi \n \n4 | P a g e  \n \ndifferent national and international institutions. The ongoing research networks include: \nIntellectual History Research Group (IHRG), Comparative Federalists Research Group (CFRG), \nGlobal Justice Research Group (GJRC), Modern South Asian Thinkers, Peace and Security in \nInternational Politics Research Network (PSIP), Feminist Engagements with Law and the State \n(FELS), Southeast Asia Research Group (SEARG), Research Network on Modern South Asian \nThinkers (MSAT), Comparative Political Theory Research Group (CPTRG).",

    "text": "This course proposes to build on a prior understanding of the nature and value of theoretical \ninquiry in politics. Political theory begins with a few fundamental questions that have a bearing on \nthe good life, and the ways in which we seek to collectively secure it. It does not claim to have any \nfinal answers to such questions and instead acknowledges disagreements. Our basic disagreements \non how we must constitute our collective life are part of our evaluations that we make on a \ncontinual basis of the political and social order we inhabit. Evaluation usually entails an intense \nengagement with the political context within which we live, the nature of our values and political \ninstitutions, their clarification and analyses, together with weighing the necessity of just \ninstitutions and values. The activity of evaluation lays bare a wide range of arguments that are \nused in political discourse sharpening thereby our political judgment. It is imperative to evaluate, \nargue and judge and then raise for the consideration of justification our existing or appropriate \npolitical practices, decisions, policies and institutions.",

Focusing, in particular, on societies that experienced colonial rule, it explores how the \ncolonial intervention shaped identities, and moulded the patterns of identity-based mobilization \nthat unfolded over the colonial era and postcolonial phase. It examines the politics of nationhood, \nand its intersection with the politics of race, caste, religion, and gender, and the efforts made by \npostcolonial states to deal with cultural difference and conflict, and historically deep ascriptive \ninequalities. Identities are shaped not merely by state processes, but also by mobilization \nundertaken by parties and movements, often in response to state processes themselves; the course \ntraces the interaction between identities and this mobilizational politics. Finally, it explores how \nidentity politics has impacted various facets of the process of democratization in postcolonial \nsocieties.",

The students will explore this relationship by asking questions about law’s \norigins (viz., the colonial state, a nationalist elite, popular struggles), the plural sites in which \nstruggles around laws takes place, and the manner in which legal categories are produced and \ncontested. In this context, it also aims to problematize the notion of crime, by locating the \nhistorical and political contexts within which definitions of crime and its transformations take \nplace. Specific laws, judgments which enhance the frontiers of law, and government reports form \na significant content of the course. Law and judicial pronouncements have to be woven into the \ndynamics of Indian politics and examined in their specific historical context as well as for their \nenduring significance in the larger political process.

Structurally, it envisions global \npolitics as composed of a hierarchy of nations with varying degrees of cooperation and \ncompetition. It specifies the relative roles of nations within this hierarchy, the system of governing \nrules, and then outlines how powerful countries attempt to manage global politics. This course \nshall introduce the theoretical foundations of power transition in international relations, and the \nchanging nature of power relationships that led to the dynamic structure of international system. \nFurther, the foreign policy implications for the major global and regional powers – the United \nStates, Russia, China and the European Union shall be examined through the lens of power \ntransition in establishing a multi polar international system.",

The course explains as to how in recent \ntimes, the genealogy and archeology of the religious and political thought in Islam and its \nconnection with the systemic contours of societies and political institutions has emerged to be one \nof the most contested subjects in humanities and social sciences. The course then lays out as to \nhow such an interest has been the product of the radicalization of political Islam and the growing \nunhealthy interface that has developed between Islam and violence, as a result of the globalization \nof Jihad that has brought in the medieval notions of a contest between abode of Islam (Dar al-\nIslam) and the land of unbelievers (Dar al-harb). Owing to this, Islam has become a prominent \nelement in the sphere of security studies. On this count, the study of Islam becomes very crucial \nfor the students of International Relations.",

The course \nwill consider a number of conceptual and policies’ questions and explore how the South Asian \nregion has been transforming with the globalization of its economy, the resurgent ethnic conflicts, \nsituated in a nuclearized security environment and the ever deepening and rapidly pervading \nconnections with the global and local extremism and terrorism. The students will then be \nintroduced to international relations theories and discuss their applicability to understand various \nstrands of South Asian dynamics. Further, the course will cover a broad spectrum of security \nissues wherein focus is on the conflict between India and Pakistan; nuclear proliferation in the \nregion; the spread of transnational terrorist forces; left wing insurgency and ethno-nationalistic \nconflicts. Besides, major issues and prospects involved in regional cooperation will also be \ndiscussed. Additionally, aspects relating to democratization, development, energy security and \nenvironmental concerns will also be dealt with.

    "text": "Unit description \n This unit primarily deals with the question as to how can we use the theories of international \nrelations to understand security issues, State structure and governance, and conflict and \ncooperation in South Asia. As regards international relations itself, it is a young discipline in \nSouth Asia and the region’s contribution towards the mainstream disciplinary evolution has also \nbeen minimal. Scholars from the region have largely attempted at interpreting South Asian \ndynamics from the perspective of West generated discourses. So, the study of the epistemic \nfoundations of IR theory in South Asia still remains unexplored. In the light of this lacuna and the \ndominance of the Euro-American centric theories in the study of IR, this unit intends to discuss \nthe extent to which IR theories are able to explain the complex and idiosyncratic character of \nSouth Asian dynamics. The aim here would also be to understand certain non-Western alternative \nexplanations advanced towards understanding the key issues involved in the study of international \nrelations of South Asia. Significant in this regard are Mohammed Ayoob’s conception of subaltern \nrealism and the notions of reverse and subaltern globalization.  \n1.

The consumer who is also a \ncontent-generating 'producer' marks a shift in the culture of work, labour and socialisation. These \nhave redefined the relationship between the private and the public, media representation and 'truth' \nor 'facts'. We will explore how this produces a new public and a new culture and politics.",
