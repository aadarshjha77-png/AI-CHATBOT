    "text": "Psychology at the Master’s level was introduced in Delhi University in 1957 under the \nDepartment of Philosophy and Psychology. The Department of Psychology as an independent \ndepartment was established in 1964 under the headship of Late Prof. H.C. Ganguli. \n \n \nThe Department has two units, one at the North Campus and the other at the South \nCampus established in 1981. At the North Campus the courses offered are M.A. Psychology \nand Ph.D while at South Campus the course offered is M.A. in Applied Psychology. \n \n \nIn recognition of its achievements in teaching and research, the University Grants \nCommission (UGC) identified this Department as Department of Special Assistance (DSA) \nin 1989. The two thrust areas identified are Cognitive Psychology and Applied Social \nPsychology. Two phases of the DSA Programme (10 Years) have been completed. Recently \nin 2015 UGC has recommended the Department for SAP (Special Assistance Programme). \nDepartment of Psychology was awarded “Second” position in the event “Awards for good \npractice” during the Antardhwani-2013 organized by the University of Delhi, Delhi. \n \n \nThe Department has a total strength of 13 teaching faculty out of which currently there are 3 \nProfessors, 3 Associate Professors and 4 Assistant Professors. This includes 1 Professor and \n1Associate Professor in the Applied Psychology Unit at the South Delhi Campus. The \nteaching and research programme is supported by the technical staff at different levels. Apart \nfrom the Student Laboratory, meant for the practicum work for the students at the Master’s \nlevel, we have a few research labs, equipped with necessary amenities. The Seminar Room is \nequipped with the State-of-the-Art facilities. Presently the best and latest technology gadgets \nhave been procured and set up to enhance the teaching and research activities. One of the \nstrength of the teaching programme is to establish interface with Industries and Organizations \nworking in varied domains as hospitals, NGOs, Corporate Sectors etc. The M.A. Psychology \nand Applied Psychology Courses include the latest trends in Psychology, with emphasis on \npractical training and field work.  The courses lay special emphasis on the acquisition of \n~ 3 ~ \n \nknowledge and skills through theoretical understanding and its practical implications. The \nDepartment has already initiated the process of revising all the courses at the undergraduate \nand postgraduate level. In addition to lecturing as the primary mode of instruction, teaching is \nalso interactive with due emphasis on seminar, presentations and discussions and also \nexperiential exercises and peer mentoring. \n \n \nThe Departmental teaching, research and field training are centred around contemporary \nissues        as stress and health, ageing, drug abuse, community mental health, disability, \nneuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation, etc. A large number of our Master’s and \nPh.D \nstudents \nafter \ncompleting \ntheir \ndegrees \nare \nemployed \nby \ndifferent \norganizations/hospitals \ndealing \nwith \nthese \nissues. \n \nFrom time to time, the Department organizes Conferences, Seminars, Refresher Course, \nWorkshops, etc. for the benefit of faculty and students. It has hosted the Indian Science \nCongress Sessions thrice as well as an International Conference and various National Level \nConferences. The Department has organized conferences on Cognitive Psychology, Quality \nof Life, Human Resource Development. Culture and Psychology, Health Psychology, Affect, \nIdentity and Discourse, Puzzles of Perception and on Indian Psychology. In addition, many \nresearch projects have also been undertaken. The department has signed a MOU with San \nDiego State University which involves collaboration in  teaching and research. \nThe Department of Psychology has been granted the Special Assistance Program (SAP) by \nthe University Grants Commission in 2016. The thrust areas of SAP project are:  Institution \nBuilding, working with vulnerabilities, and Health and Well-being. The SAP project is in its \nfirst phase of implementation, under which various programs are being carried out by the \nfaculty members like undertaking research around the thrust areas, organizing conferences \nand seminars and teaching-community interface activities.",

It would \nfacilitate acquiring specialized knowledge, inculcating relevant attitude, values and a sense of \nempowerment. It recognizes multiplicity in ways and means of knowledge-creation and \napplications. To this end the students will be familiarized with plurality in perspectives, \npedagogy and their implications. The course would allow students to nurture their academic \ninterests in specialized domains of psychology, along with quest for personal growth and \ncitizenship.The Department holds the provision for inclusion of new courses and \nmodification of presented ones during a given academic year. In preparation of the courses \nthe element of interdisciplinarity is kept in view and embedded in the courses. Reading \nmaterial will be made available by concerned faculty.",

Open Electives (skill based papers) \n 1. Core courses of the curriculum are designed to promote common educational edifice \nwithout which a particular discipline cannot be taught. They are necessary as they enable the \nstudents to take up more specialized course of their choice later on.  \n2. Elective courses would cater to specialization in particular domains. They must highlight \nthe conceptual foundations, pedagogical considerations and specific set of skills required \nwithin semester frame. They would strive to bring in a process orientation. These courses \nwould be taught through workshop/experiential/reflective mode, and assessment would be \ndone by process driven activities.  \n3. Open Elective courses should also be designed and developed keeping in view the market \ndemands and core competencies available within the discipline of psychology, which would \nbe taught with the blend of pedagogies relevant for psychology as a subject.",

    "text": "1. These courses were designed and developed by smaller groups of faculty members. At \nleast two faculty members were assigned the task of designing the Core and Elective papers. \nThey were given the choice of co-opting experts in that domain. \n 2. The courses were designed to be commensurate with the credit system, which requires a \nminimum of 40-50 hours of active engagement over a semester. \n 3. The faculty decided in the beginning, through a number of deliberations, regarding \nnumber of elective papers. It is important to note here that India is a diverse country and \nexpertise in all the optional papers may not be available in all the colleges and Universities \nacross India. It was advised to create adequate options to provide a comprehensive coverage \nof the discipline and also to the institutions where it would/could be taught.  \n4. It was envisaged to provide learning possibilities with a high degree of specialization and \nin-depth knowledge in at least one area/domain of the discipline, or more than one. \nNonetheless, developing and retaining appropriate level of skills to enhance employment \nopportunities in different domains was decided to be a concurrent priority while designing the \ncourses. It is to be remembered that a significant number of students enrol in the Graduation \nProgram after having done Psychology in grade XII. Larger number of students, however, \nhave previous study exposure from other streams of sciences, arts and commerce. Therefore, \none of the principles that was kept in mind was that the transition be made smooth both from \ncontent as well as process orientation of teaching.",
