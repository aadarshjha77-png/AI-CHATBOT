    "text": "The Department of Genetics was established in 1984, as a part of the Faculty of Inter-\ndisciplinary & Applied Sciences at the University of Delhi South Campus (UDSC). The \ndepartment over the years has emerged as a strong hub for training students and for pursuing \nquality research in two broad areas of food and health, both with significant societal impact.  \nNotable scientific contributions from the department in the recent past include i) screening \nof 200,000 newborns for inborn errors of metabolism collaborating with 20 hospitals across \nthe Delhi state, and generating the first ever epidemiological and genetic data for over 45 \ncommon and rare genetic disorders in the country- a good example of translational research \nand technology for the masses; ii) discovery of putative causal genes for a few brain disorders; \niii) spearheading research on transgenic mustard for hybrid seed production, approved by the \nGenetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) - a first such translational product from any \nuniversity in India; and iii)   development of non-transgenic hybrids of mustard with improved \noil quality which has  already reached the farmer’s field.  \nThe two-year post-graduate (M.Sc.) program, the new one-year post-graduate program and \nthe Ph.D. program offered by the department are based on this strong foundation of research. \nThe department enjoys a unique strength of having teaching faculty with research \nspecialization using a range of model systems such as Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Yeast, \nDictyostelium, and human cell-line models.  The M.Sc. program is open to students with \nBachelor’s degree in any area of science (biological/chemical/physical) through a national \nlevel entrance test. The curriculum spread over four semesters, aims at teaching not only the \nbasics of the science of heredity but also emerging concepts in almost all related disciplines \nof biology. Another distinct feature of this course is the hands-on-training imparted to the \nstudents. Emphasis is given to laboratory based learning including a small project work during \nthe fourth semester wherein students are encouraged to conceptualize, design and perform \nexperiments to answer a basic question related to their respective mentors’ research \nprogramme, trouble shoot, interpret their data, write a report and also give an oral \npresentation at the end of the semester. The approach of a restrictive practical performed in \na narrow time-frame is not supported, thus giving all students an opportunity to hone their \nskills across semesters.  \nStudents with Master’s degree in any area of sciences with an aptitude to work in the broad \nresearch programs of the department are selected for the Ph.D program based on a national \nlevel entrance test/interview and have to complete a 12 credit course before they can \nproceed with their experimental work. Ph.D work generally spans over five to six years \nfollowed by a rigorous thesis defense and viva-voce examination. \nResearch is an integral part of the departmental academic activity. Research programs of the \nfaculty using cutting edge technology are focused on basic aspects of genetics, genomics and \nmolecular biology with direct implications for crop improvement and health/disease. Specific \nprojects under the plant sciences include high resolution mapping and marker assisted \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n4 \nbreeding in mustard; development of pathogen using RNAi technology; understanding plant-\npathogen interactions using conventional and contemporary OMICS approaches in \nArabidopsis and Tobacco; and unravelling promoter architecture for regulation of transgene \nexpression in plants. Biomedical research projects include identification of pre-disposing and \nsomatic mutations in cancer using liquid biopsy and tissues, studying molecular mechanisms \nin cancer stemness, progression and therapy in the microenvironment; determining \nmolecular mechanisms underlying cellular toxicity and polyQ induced neurodegeneration in \nHuntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases using Drosophila as a model system; studying gene-\nenvironment interactions, understanding cell signalling in stress and development with \nDictyostelium as a test system; and mitochondrial genetics and ribosomal biology using yeast \nprovide insights into important basic biological processes. \nResearch projects in the department have attracted generous funding support from various \nagencies including Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Indian Council of Medical Research \n(ICMR) Anusandhan National Research Funding (ANRF, erstwhile Science and Engineering \nResearch Board), Council of Science and Industrial Research (CSIR) and University Grants \nCommission (UGC). The department houses two Centres of Excellence supported by DBT and \nICMR. The department has also been recognized and supported by UGC-SAP (DRS-III) and DST-\nFIST (level II) programs. Ph.D. scholars in the department are encouraged to avail independent \nfellowships and are also supported with fellowships from the university or extramural grants. \nA well-equipped instrumentation facility for imaging, genomics, proteomics and \ntranscriptomics both in the department as well as the Central Instrumentation Facility of \nSouth Campus have been an exemplary support for carrying out high quality research.  \nFinally, contemporary and relevant syllabi for the Master’s course, ongoing research projects \nof societal relevance together with dedicated and high performing doctoral students and \nfaculty have enabled the department of genetics to emerge and stay in the forefront of \nteaching and research in different branches of Genetics in the country.  \n \n \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n5",

It paves way for multi-disciplinary education and empowers students through \nflexibility in choice of courses for choosing their own learning trajectories and programmes, and \nthereby choose their paths in life with appropriate career choices, including option for mid-way course \ncorrections, according to their talents and interests.  \nCredit and Credit Points  \n'Credit' is recognition that a learner has completed a prior course of learning, corresponding to a \nqualification at a given level. For each such prior qualification, the student would have put in a certain \n34 volume of institutional or workplace learning, and the more complex a qualification, the greater \nthe volume of learning that would have gone into it.  \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n6 \n(i) \nCredits quantify learning outcomes that are subject achieving the prescribed learning \noutcomes to valid, reliable methods of assessment.  \n(ii) \nThe credit points will give the learners, employers, and institutions a mechanism for \ndescribing and comparing the learning outcomes achieved.

    "text": "The M.Sc. Genetics program in Semesters I and II is carefully structured to balance theoretical \nunderstanding with practical application.  \nThe 4 Credit Practical DSC \nOver the years, the Department of Genetics has moved away from conventional, stand-alone \n“boxed” experiments toward a more open-ended, inquiry-driven pedagogical approach. Our \nemphasis is not on teaching protocols or fixed techniques but on encouraging students to \nexplore, experiment, and question.  \nThis often leads to surprising observations, fostering discussions and deeper understanding. \nSuch experiences spark curiosity, build scientific temper, and nurture the courage to \nquestion—an essential quality for any researcher or professional. These practical modules are \ndesigned as continuous investigative experiences, not just technical routines. Through this \nprocess, students also gain essential research skills such as data collection, analysis, scientific \nwriting, and presentation. The goal is to help students understand core concepts and begin \nthinking and working like scientists. \nRole Of Tutorials In Our Curriculum \nTutorials in our curriculum are not just meant for clearing doubts. While, they remain a space \nfor one to one interactions, they been designed in a manner that they can be used to discuss \nimportant scientific discoveries and encourage open debates. Students get a chance to read, \npresent and discuss key research papers, helping them understand how scientific ideas are \ndeveloped and tested over time. Together, these elements make tutorials a vital part of our \ncurriculum, helping students think critically, communicate effectively, and engage with the \nscientific process. \nThe 2 Credit Skill Based Papers \nThe skill-based courses in line with the NEP  emphasis on experiential, hands-on learning along \nwith academic knowledge. These subjects equip students with essential tools for scientific \ninquiry—biostatistics trains them in quantitative reasoning and data analysis using software \nplatforms relevant to modern biology, while microscopy builds a skill important in the \nresearch field and for studying many biological processes. Both have strong cross-disciplinary \nrelevance, contributing to fields as diverse as genetics, public health, biotechnology, \nenvironmental science, and clinical research. By working with real data, instruments, and \nanalytical methods, students will develop competencies that are directly applicable in \nresearch and industry settings, enhancing both their academic foundation and career \nreadiness. \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n16 \nCOURSE DETAILS\nALL PAPERS OFFERED IN \nSEMESTER 1 OF THE 2Y-PG\nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n17 \nBiological Processes and Patterns of Inheritance \nCourse Objective: The undergraduate genetics course typically focuses on inheritance patterns \nthrough ratios and numbers, often presented as an isolated subject without connections to \nbroader biological processes. This course aims to bridge that gap by linking previously learned \nconcepts to various biological mechanisms, fostering a deeper understanding and greater \nconceptual clarity for students. The syllabus reflects the various areas that will be covered, not \nnecessarily in a linear fashion but by cross-referencing between units to enhance integrated \nlearning. This is a primer to an advanced course to be offered in semester III. The experiential \nlearning included in this paper would lead to appreciation of organisms and develop observational \nskills of learners. \nTotal \nTheory \nPractical \nTutorial \nCredits \n 4 \n3 \n1 \n0 \nHours \n75 \n45 \n30 \n0 \nUnit \nUnit Name \nHours \nTheory \nI \nBiological Processes \n10 \nII \nVariation: Key to Inheritance Biology \n8 \nIII \nInheritance patterns \n24 \nIV \nThe Good, The Bad, The Ugly \n3 \nPractical \nI \nIntroduction to Model Organisms - Observation and Handling \n20 \nII \nTracking Variations- Identifying Mutant Phenotypes \n10 \nCourse Outcome: On completing ‘Biological Processes and Patterns of Inheritance’ the \nstudents would have: \n•\nDeveloped a holistic understanding of genetic principles, inheritance patterns, genetic\nvariation, and molecular mechanisms governing phenotypic expression, linking\nclassical concepts to broader biological processes.\n•\nAnalysed genetic variation and its role in Inheritance by exploring mutation sources,\nallele interactions, recombination, and the use of genetic markers to track variations,\nand diversity in populations.\n•\nCritically examined the impact of genetics on medicine, agriculture, and society.\n•\nLearnt the nuances and developed appropriate skills of handling and maintaining\norganisms for genetic analysis.\n•\nDeveloped keen observational powers, a key to being a good geneticist\nSEMESTER 1 \n DSC-GEN-101 \n 2Y-PG \nProposed Evaluation \nExam \nTotal Marks Hours \nTheory \n75 \n    3 \nPractical \n25 \n    3 \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n18 \nContent (Theory) \nI. \nBiological Processes                                                                                                             \n- \nLife Cycles of Organisms  \n- \nA comparative overview with examples from microbes, plants and animals \nwith reference to genetic analysis                      \n- \nCellular Basis of Inheritance \n- \nMitosis and Meiosis: A comparative analysis as mechanisms ensuring genetics \nconsistency versus genetic diversity \n- \nFertilization: restoring diploidy, introducing variability through gamete fusion. \n- \nA review of cell structure and developmental processes with reference to \ninheritance patterns \n- \nMolecular basis of phenotypic expression \n- \nDominant, recessive, co-dominant, incomplete dominant phenotypes \n- \nBiochemical pathways as foundation to phenotypic outcomes due to gene \ninteractions \n- \nInfluence of environment \n- \nPleiotropy, penetrance and expressivity. \nII.
