In brief, the Svabhāvavādins maintain that a thing has its own, i.e. independent es-\nsence or nature which is unchangingly eternal (=Being), while the Niḥsvabhāvavādins \nlike Nāgārjuna deny it by saying that ontologically a thing is dependently arising or per-\nspective-generated (=becoming). \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

We will study Plato’s ideas about virtue, knowledge, \nand method in philosophy through the Meno. Plato’s explorations in the “Sun, Line and \nCave” portions in the Republic remains central to this day regarding a conception of the \nworld and the things in it and the status of their existence. While this course will cover \nthat, it will also cover Aristotle’s thoughts on what nature is, what we should study when \nwe study nature, what the four causes are, and why luck is not a cause. To add to this, we \nwill also do sections from Aristotle’s De Anima, trying to figure out an early exploration \nof issues related to philosophy of mind.  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

Questions such as this are raised in the realm of normative ethics. \nThis course will look at some ethical theories that engage with this and closely related \nquestions. It will survey how these theories attempt to provide principles to determine \nwhat is good or bad, right or wrong.  Aristotle approaches the question of morality in \nterms of happiness. To Mill the principle of Utility or the greatest happiness of the great-\nest number is the core principle. While for Kant it is only by being rational that an agent \ncan make the right choice. Some critical views are included. Additionally, this course \ncontains a reading on care ethics which claims that most of the above theories ignore the \nexperience of women. Two readings on Indian ethics are included as well in order that \nnormative ethics may be explored in a more comprehensive way.   \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Aristotle. (1980, reprint).

The focus will be on the criteria for and char-\nacteristics of knowledge, criteria that may set limits to what we can know, and character-\nistics that may mark off knowledge from mere belief. The chief questions that will en-\ngage our attention are: definition of valid knowledge, criteria for testing the proposed va-\nlidity, instruments of valid knowledge, and their respective accounts.  \n \nEssential Readings \n1.

While some philosophers like Descartes and Leibnitz traced the origin and validity of \nknowledge primarily to reason, others like Locke and Hume traced it to sense experience. \nKant criticized both approaches – placing emphasis on the contribution of the knowing \nmind.  But he was also skeptical of reason reaching out of experience and grasping at ob-\njects that we have no experience of.

Do we always have excellent reasons to do what morality commands us to do? \nFor the present course, the central metaethical question would be about the truth of moral \nclaims, i.e., about their objectivity.  \n27 \n27 \n \nEssential Readings \n1.

The course aims to show how this trans-\nparency and determinacy of meaning was sought to be ensured in both logical atomism \n(early Wittgenstein and Russell) and logical positivism (Ayer or Carnap) through a \nunique analysis of each individual proposition into a set of pre-semantic simples. The \nsecond phase of the course is an attack on this essentialist agenda of an ideal language \nand its supposedly transparent relation with reality, covering principally the views of \nQuine and later Wittgenstein.  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

What is the relation between theory \nand observation in science? What is the role of so-called ‘scientific revolutions’?

The selections from Aristotle's Meta-\nphysics included in this course look at his theory of being and the method proper to an \ninvestigation of the question of being. A close textual reading of the relevant and pre-\nscribed sections will enable students to become conversant with the conceptual frame-\nwork that was to hold sway in philosophical discussions until the 17th Century. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

It’ll explore the significance of anekantavada in the context of these \ntwo concepts and also examine the relevance of these concepts in promoting a non-\ncoercive social order. We will also attempt a comparative reading of Gandhi’s thoughts \nwith that of Mill and Kant in order to highlight the non-Eurocentric nature of Gandhi’s \nthought. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

Why \nshould anyone write? Why write novels and poems? How are we supposed to tell the dif-\nference between a good work of art and a bad work of art? Is the history of art merely a \npile of works of art? What happens when we read a novel? What is it to enter another \nperson’s imaginary world? This course will look at three acclaimed authors who have \nthought about these issues and have written about the experience of the art of writing. \nThe emphasis is in trying to answer the questions by looking at what authors say about it \nthemselves.   \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

It aims to examine the boundaries of moral concern drawn \nup in each approach critically. The course will also introduce some alternative ways of \napproaching an ethics of environment that are becoming quite central in environmental \nliterature today. The section on eco- feminism will particularly draw our attention to rela-\ntion between domination of women and domination of nature, and radical development of \nnew idea in historical, social, economic and cultural as the new beginning. In the last sec-\ntion we study what has been the popular movements in this area and what are the main \nconcerns , also try to see a more practical aspect by carving out the road map ahead. \n \nEssential Readings \nDeep Ecology \n1.

For many, it seems to be defined primarily in terms of \nwealth, status, power attaining which remains the primary drive for them to do actions, \nalong with the significant concern for good physical and mental health, good relation-\nships, ample free time for entertainment, hobbies and family members, helping others in \nneed, enjoying sensory pleasures, etc. to make the overall life as balanced, happy and \nharmonious. For some, meaning of life may lie in a fanatical dedication towards certain \nreligious or socio-political ideology. For a few, probably, the meaning of life seems to be \ndecided by the dedication towards the intrinsic joy in certain intense, absorbing activities \nlike painting, archery, music, dance, philosophy, etc, and so on. What can be the criteri-\non/criteria to decide the ‘valid’ meaning of life? Is it one or many for the whole of man-\nkind? Is the meaning of life already decided or fixed by some external agency like God or \nstate, or it is primarily decided by one’s own individual choice? But is there any limit to \n50 \n50 \none’s choice or one is absolutely free in choosing whatever captures his/her fancies? This \ncourse tries to raise and explore such questions through existentialist, psychological and \nspiritual insights and literary works embodying such musings through their characters \nand plots around them.   \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

It also tries \nto deal with the problem of whether we have any knowledge at all, and if we do have \nknowledge, then whether it has any foundations or not. The subject has ancient roots and \nmodern discussion is rich and varied. There are many branches of epistemology as well \nfrom classical epistemology to virtue epistemology to knowledge first epistemology.  In \nthis course we will cover just a few of the questions that are raised in the subject. Our ap-\nproach will try to cover some of the classical issues. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Stroud, B.

But somewhere somehow philosophy has still missed out on \nquestioning ‘what is given’ with respect to bodies. This in past has paved way to the de-\nbates around feminism and is generating some discontent in many others making space \nfor many new discourses around the social and historical construct of ‘body’.  \nThis course examines what is it that philosophy also tends to take for-granted  And will \ndiscuss ‘What is normal’ and will lay out the importance of questioning normativity; \nthus, the course is expected to provide tools for conceptualizing Normativity by way of  \ninvestigating Normativity of the Body which is disabled, engendered,  and which is con-\nfined by Sexuality and Ethnicity.  \n \nThe course will enable Students to further analyze the Systems built upon the no-\ntion of Normativity like the pedagogical systems, Cultural Practices (including literature, \nmedia, performance, Governance (Including policies) and Construction of Criminality \n(Policing -social or otherwise, Laws and Acts) \n \nPart 1: Investigating Normativity of the \"Body\" \nI. \nDisability \nII. \nSexuality \nIII.

This introductory course on some selected \ntopics in cognitive science touches upon some foundational issues of mental states, men-\ntal processes, and mental architecture. It starts, chronologically, with some accounts of \nthe mental as given in Yoga Sūtra, a classical Indian text. Then, it segue into some of the \nfinest seventeenth and eighteenth century philosophical writings on the topic, through \nsome important concepts of the mental as discussed in philosophy. After the readings on \n56 \n56 \nmental states, the course moves on to the cognitive revolution in the last century and fo-\ncuses on the topic of mental process. The final part of the course deals with some recent \naccounts on mental architecture. \nAn up to date reading list, live seminar/webinar links, and other relevant information will \nbe shared on a continuous basis as the course progresses.  \n \nEssential Readings  \n \n1.

In the days of Vedic culture, women stood as a decisive force in spirituality \nand the foundation of moral development. There were also women rishis who revealed \nthe Vedic knowledge to others. For example, the 126th hymn of the first book of the Rig-\nVeda was revealed by a Vedic woman whose name was Romasha; the 179 hymn of the \nsame book was by Lopamudra, another inspired Vedic woman. There are many Brahma-\nvadinis in mediviel to modern era like Andal, Akka Mahadevi, Lal Ded etc. This course \nwill focus and established new paradigm for unknown philosophies of Vedic Women. \nCourse Content \n1.

It is important to note that anumāna is not \nlogic in the Western sense, because it has its own way of doing logic, which is technically called \nanumāna-pramāṇa. The course will focus on such issues as the definition, nature, factors (pramā, \nprameya, pramatṛ, pramāṇa, and pramāṇaphala), process, kinds, linguistic-psychological-\nsyllogistic characteristics, criteria (rūpa) of reason or sign (liṅga, hetu), and sign (liṅga)-signified \n(liṅgin) relation while discussing  the inferential means of knowledge (anumāna-pramāṇa).   \nEssential Readings \n1.

Concepts are central parts of this architec-\nture. But how are they represented in the mind/brain: in the abstract amodel form or in \nmodality specific systems? - this question is also considered in this course. Under devel-\nopmental, embodied-enactive and dynamical system perspectives the present course ex-\n67 \n67 \nplores interactions at several levels, between brain, body and environment, and between \nperception, thought and action for the construction (or shaping up) of human cogni-\ntion/mind, perception and language.    \n \nEssential Readings  \n \n1.

This course aims at investigating whether belief in the distinct-\nness of biological processes is maintainable in light of current philosophical debates. To-\nwards meeting of this goal, the course endeavors to introduce students to such basic bio-\nlogical concepts as the nature of evolution, natural selection, adaptation, biological design \nand gene. The debates over the possibility of adopting reductionism in biology as well as \nethical and social consequences of adoption of evolutionary theory are also examined. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

It tries to answer questions about the \nnature of knowledge and the value of knowledge together by concentrating on centering \nknowledge in intellectual ability. Knowledge is success attributed to an agent’s ability. \nAnd we value an act performed with competence, hence we value knowledge over true \nbelief. This course will study the key writings of the protagonists of Virtue Epistemology, \nviz. Ernest Sosa, John Greco and Linda Zagzebski, J. Kvanvig, apart from other philoso-\nphers. We will also study intellectual humility, a specific intellectual virtue. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Battaly, H. (2012). Virtue epistemology. In John Greco and John Turri (Eds.)

(ii) It explores and develops its ability on \nthe basis of ancient conceptual resources to be a philosophy of unity, harmony, active tol-\nerance, respect for the other (both human and non-human), and peace. (iii) In metaphysi-\ncal sense, it tries to propound not only a common humanity but also a unified interde-\npendent world. (iv) In epistemological sense, it focuses on the development of the indi-\nvidual self (atman) into the Absolute Cosmic Self (Brahman) through knowledge (jñāna). \n(v) In axiological sense, it values the spiritual development of non-dual worldview (sat), \npurified mind (cit), and bliss (ānanda).

It studies the structure of various types of experience ranging \nfrom perception, thought, memory, imagination, emotion, desire, and volition to bodily \nawareness, embodied action, and social activity, including linguistic activi-\nty.   Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for centuries, but it came into \nits own in the early 20th century in the works of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-\nPonty and others.  The methods and characterization of the discipline were widely debat-\ned by Husserl and his successors, and these debates continue to the present day. In this \ncourse we will have a broader overview of the field in the works of Husserl and \nHeidegger.  \n \nEssential Readings  \n1. Moran, D. (2000).  Introduction.

The course gleans philosophical insights from the discoveries of modern physics, \ni.e. Theories of Relativity (Special Theory of Relativity, General Theory of Relativity) \nand Quantum Mechanics for the conventional philosophical problems regarding nature of \nreality, knowledge, causality, space, time, and nature and origin of human mind or con-\nsciousness and life, and so on. It also discusses epistemological questions in science and \nin general that quantum mechanics raises, e.g., what it means to attribute probabilities to \nphysical events, what the aims of scientific inquiry are - does it aim at something true, or \nmerely at something useful? Further, what the role of observation is in constructing a sci-\nentific theory, what it means to say that there is an \"objective\" physical world, whether \nsomething as basic as logic can be viewed as an empirical discipline, whether there can \nbe meaningful scientific questions whose answers cannot possibly be settled by experi-\nment, and so on.  \n \nEssential Readings  \n \n1.

In other \nwords, does love requires efforts?  How is (romantic) love connected with lust and infat-\nuation? Is marriage a necessary culmination of love?What are the diverse obstacles to the \nexperience of love, the consequences of absence of love, and the insatiable desire for love \nwhich propels, influences and ultimately motivates much of our behaviour. Further, is \nlove actually possible, or is it just an ideal, a fantasy, an illusion, or a comforting aspira-\ntion which enables a palliative denial and distortion of the reality of human being? Then, \ndoes romantic love necessarily involve developing a ‘joint identity’ (the ‘we’ identity, or \n‘shared’ identity born out of merging)? What about individuality and personal identity for \npeople in love? What can be the relationship between individuality, mergingand the dy-\nnamic system theory? How is love connected with spirituality? Is eros (romantic or sexu-\nal love) different from agape (unconditional or spiritual love)? Is devotional love the \nsame as compassion, or love for humanity? Is compassion or loving-kindness a strength \nor a weakness? How can love be differentiated from addiction?

This study of \nthe adhyāsabhāṣya with commentaries to the first four Brahmasūtras (catuḥsūtrī) will \ngive the students an insight into classical methods of analyses and synthesis and richness \nembedded in text and tradition. Two ingenious interpretations of Śaṃkara’s Adhyāsa-\nbhāṣya by Vācaspati Miśra (Bhāmatī) of 9th century and Ganeswar Mishra of 20th century \nwill also be introduced in this paper to have different overviews of the text. \n \nEssential Readings \n1.

The need for investigation of \nthese themes in a comparative perspective becomes all the more pressing when we recall \nefforts by Buddhist scholars at viewing Yogācāra as Buddhist phenomenology. This \ncourse takes a close look at the following themes while looking at the commonality of \nissues and their treatment in Yogācāra Buddhism and Husserlian phenomenology: The \nnature and object of cognition; intentionality of consciousness and centrality of its role in \ncognition; the nature of objects and investigation of its constitutive elements; theories of \nactive and passive constitution; the nature of noesis and noema, etc.  \n \nEssential Readings \n1.

    "text": "Though the controversies surrounding the nature of mind are almost as old as human \nhistory, a particular understanding of mind that has occupied the central position in \ncontemporary discussions on the topic has been the modularity approach. Whether you \nare for it or against it, but you can’t ignore it. In the present course we not only look at \nthe modularity thesis and its rejection, but we also have a look at various versions of the \n88 \n88 \nmodularist thesis. That is, whether only peripheral aspects of the mind are modular \nleaving out central systems (eg. Fodor and his followers), or whether mind is entirely \n(i.e., massively) modular (eg.Pinker, Sperber, and Cosmides&Tooby). We also focus on \nthe issue of whether modularity of mind is a biological given (i.e. innate), or a \nconsequence of the developmental process (i.e. modularized a la Karmiloff-Smith).    \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

Is consciousness that necessary evolutionary step without which distinctly \nhuman phenomena like conscience and religion will not be possible? Such questions \n89 \n89 \nabout the nature of consciousness have been asked for centuries and across cultures.

The discussion surrounding the following topics forms the focus of the \ncourse: the different strands of evolutionary thinking like probabilistic epigenesis and de-\nvelopmentalist, the nature of adaptation, the concept of constraint in the biological sci-\nences, issues surrounding the nature of selection & drift, and interrogating the idea of \nprogress in biological sciences. The course ends by discussing whether evolutionary theo-\nry can throw some light on complex behavior patterns, like, altruism and selfishness.  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. *West-Eberhard, M. J.

It thus presents the pos-\nsibility of an alternative method of language/sign analysis, different from both the ana-\nlytic and the hermeneutic traditions.

Engagement with criticism was fairly central to Gandhi’s \nlife and thought and the debate with Tagore is important to an understanding of Gandhi \nas a philosopher. Between 1915 and 1941 Tagore raised arguments against satyagraha, \nthe non-cooperation movement, boycott of Government schools, the burning of foreign \ncloth and Gandhi’s connection between spinning and swaraj. It appears that the issues \nthat divided Gandhi and Tagore were more substantial than might appear from a consid-\neration of the immediate differences between them. This paper argues that the debate was \nprimarily about truth, possibilities of untruth and the nature of freedom/Swaraj. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Bhattacharya, S. (Comp. & Ed.). (2008).

The idea is intuitively appealing but needs close scrutiny since intuitive \nappeal might be a good starting point but not a compelling evidence. There have been \nsimilar voices expressing the influence or constituting effect of language on the thought \nby Wittgenstein, Vygotsky, Whorf in the nearly first half of 20th century, and by Car-\nruthers, Clark, etc.  in recent times.

This course shall incorporate some standard theories on aspect \nperception  - both traditional and modern  - and identify the exact  points in which they  \nconverge and disperse. We shall  ultimately privilege later Wittgenstein’s view  of aspect-\nperception to show how it outgrows the standard dichotomies in this area to   eke out a \n101 \n101 \nnew approach in both the spheres of   language and mind. The course will explore how \nthis notion has been effectively deployed in various fields other than that of perception – \nviz. in   the discourse on self, action, language and mathematics.  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

This very issue was considered with great subtlety in the Vedic tradition of \nIndia. Here we consider one of the later classics of this tradition that deals with the ques-\ntion of consciousness, laws, and freedom-the justly famous Śiva Sūtras. \n \nMain Topics \n \n1. Universal consciousness (The Śiva Śūtras, chp.1) \n2. The emergence of innate knowledge (The Śiva Śūtras, chp.2) \n3.

The whole exercise is the part of the schema to \ndevelop the process of contemplation in order to know the bare truth of the originary con-\nsciousness by dissolving various modes of defiled consciousness in order to facilitate the \nphenomenological, epistemological, and psychological analyses. The results achieved \nthrough this exercise are utilized by both essentialist and anti-essentialist doctrinal posi-\ntions. It is even utilized for spiritual goals like liberation (mokṣa, nirvāṇa, kaivalya, etc.). \nWithout the meditation technique, it is not possible to realize the freedom of the invaria-\nble soul in the orthodox systems or non-substantial fluxional self in Buddhism. The \ngreatest advantage of cleansing the proliferation of mind through meditation is that in its \npurified form it is transformed into a cosmic self in the present life, beyond the contro-\nversy relating to the metaphysics of the self, in terms of universalized ethical practices. \nThis course is purely a theoretical enterprise, which creates a debate between meditation \nrelated issues dealt with by the Upaniṣadic, Yoga, and Buddhist systems of thought. We \nare not taking into consideration the contemporary study of “meditation and Neurosci-\nence of Consciousness.”  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Radhakrishnan, S.

It also undermines the tripartite divisions between perception, cogni-\ntion and action in the traditional conception of mind and presents the thesis that the three \nare actually intertwined and do not stand in isolation to each other. The approach also \nconsiders that how metaphors play a role in the architecture of cognitive structures, and \nhow nature of metaphors prevalent in a language subtly shapes the experience and cogni-\ntion of a community. It also considers that how concepts might be represented and used \nfor the abstract thinking. The course will also consider some critiques of the approach as \nwell. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

However, the analysis of the conditional \nremains a matter of contention in logical theory. There is the view that we should accept \nthe truth-functional account. But the material paradoxes present a problem. Strawson \npointed out other problems related to differences between the ordinary conditional and \nthe material one. Edgington has suggested that conditionals don’t have any truth condi-\ntions. There are views that we should accept that conditionals involve modal notions. \nSome of these views on conditionals will be covered by this course.  \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Strawson, P. F.

Truth has been taken to essen-\ntially consist in being a relation of correspondence, or of coherence or of a pragmatic \ncharacter. Deflationists think that truth has no nature as such.

Religious appeals appear to carry more weight in changing attitudes \nsuch that impact the environment positively. However most religions, particularly ancient \nones, have never witnessed or imagined the environmental degradation seen today. Can \nthey then legitimately be looked at for environmental wisdom? This course will cover \nthree religions: Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity to consider their contribution to \nenvironmental ethics.

If this is true, can there be an isolated atomic self or tran-\nscendental Self – as found in Vedanta or that is merely a fanciful idea and not a possibil-\nity? Or, does such self differ qualitatively from the empirical/phenomenal self experi-\nenced in mundane activities? Is self an ‘illusion’ without ontological reality – as found in \nBuddhist notion of Annatta or no-self? What do psychological theories and cognitive \nneuroscientific studies tell us about the notion of self for such questions? What do phe-\nnomenological insights inform us on these issues, especially the phenomenological ac-\ncounts of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau Ponty and then in modern phenome-\nnologists like Thompson, Zahavi, Gallagher, de Vignemont, Stawarska etc. How far are \nthey compatible with the modern neurological findings on the same issues? Further, is \n116 \n116 \nsense of awareness/consciousness about the objects essentially accompanied by the sense \nof self?

It tells us what is the contribution of the mind to what we call \nknowledge. The most famous case of the mind’s contribution to knowledge is in \nknowledge of language. This is brought out well in Steven Pinker’s book The Language \nInstinct. And many of his other publications. This course will reveal students to the sub-\nject of Cognitive Science and some of its main claims through Pinker’s penetrating in-\nsight and lucid discussion. \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1.

It studies the structure of various types of experience ranging \nfrom perception, thought, memory, imagination, emotion, desire, and volition to bodily \nawareness, embodied action, and social activity, including linguistic activi-\nty.   Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for centuries, but it came into \nits own in the early 20th century in the works of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-\nPonty and others, although the methods and characterization of the discipline has been \nwidely debated among its practitioners. Moving beyond Husserl and Heidegger covered \nin Phenomenology 1, this course extends to look at the views of Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, \nand also looks into the area of Hermeneutics by focusing on the works of Gadamer - one \nof the central figures in hermeneutics, profoundly affected by the Heideggerian phenom-\nenology. Hermeneutics deals with the methodology of interpretation and is typical-\nly concerned with problems that arise when dealing with meaningful human actions and \nthe products of such actions, most importantly texts. Gadamer developed a distinctive and \nthoroughly dialogical approach, grounded in Platonic-Aristotelian as well as \nHeideggerian thinking, and grounds understanding in the linguistically mediated happen-\ning of tradition.  \n \nEssential Readings  \n \n1.

The \nphilosophy of history can be understood as a critical engagement with the many questions \nthat arise from the study of history: Does history have a purpose? Does history have a \nmeaning? What patterns, if any are there in history?  Whether the historical process ex-\nhibits recognizable principles or stages of development? \n \nEssential Readings: \n \n1.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. \n \nPHIL 441: PHILOSOPHICAL COUNSELLING \n \nPhilosophical inquiry, in the Socratic tradition, is a habitual, daily practice of reflecting \nupon, clarifying, coming to see, and making sense of one's values, beliefs, ideas, judg-\nments, desires, emotions, intuitions, feelings, goals, commitments, relationships, and, in \ngeneral, all of the actions and experiences that constitute one's life. In this sense, philoso-\n121 \n121 \nphy is a way of life, to live and think critically for the views, ideas, practices which are \n'givens' by one's culture and society. Many of modern life's problems might be the result \nof failure to inculcate this attitude especially under the influence of the Other, e.g., in the \nform of making choices of career under the influence of others and not by one's own in-\nterests and strengths; displaying extravagant, luxurious lifestyle causing economical and \npsychological burden on a middle class person, and so on. This other-directedness be-\ncomes a root-cause of many psychological stresses and alienation of modern person. Phi-\nlosophy, especially under existentialism, deals with the problems of alienation, boredom, \nlack of meaning or purpose, anxiety, and so on, and strives to develop an independent, \nauthentic, individual who is not just a 'herd-follower'  - in Nietzsche's terminology, but is \ncommitted to find a genuine happiness or purpose/meaning of life in his/her own authen-\ntic manner. This authenticity or individuality is not something pregiven but is rather 'for-\nfeited' to the Otherness by an ordinary person as an 'inauthentic Da-sein' - in \nHeideggerian terminology. Phenomenological-Existential therapeutic intervention is es-\npecially suitable to work on attaining this lost individuality. Further, Existential Psychoa-\nnalysis, e.g. in the works of Binswanger, involves Husserl's concept of lifeworld as a key \nto understanding the subjective experiences of the mentally ill person, considering that in \nthe mental illness one faces modifications of the fundamental structure and of the struc-\ntural links of (Heideggerian) \"being-in-the-world\", including the lived-experience of \nspace, time, body sense and the social relationships, thus, resulting in the remaking of the \nworld for the disturbed subject. One needs to take cognizance of this remade-world for \nthe subject for his/her therapy. Moving to the Indian philosophical systems, we have am-\nple resources (theoretical and practice based), especially in the Buddhist and Vedantic, \nYogic traditions, Jain tradition, and in the Bhagavad Gita which can help one to attain a \nstable, unperturbed mind amidst of all kinds of perturbations, allures, confusions, and \nstresses. This course, thus, strives to combine philosophical theory with practical experi-\nence to develop efficient philosophical counsellors.  \nUnit – 1 \nConcepts of Intervention: Self-assertion, Self-appraisal, Self-realization, Self-restriction, \nSelf-adjustment, Selflessness, Catharsis, Articulation, World-view and Life world, Pres-\nence and Life world, coherence and meaning. \nUnit – 2 \nMethods of Intervention: Articulation, Socratic Methods, Stoics Method, Mindfulness \nmethod, Yogic Meditations,  Yoga as a way of Philosophical Intervention, Bhagvad \nGita, Rationalist method of Carvaka, Anekantavada of Jainism, Positive way of life of \nVedanta, Buddhist Techniques as Philosophical Intervention: Four Noble Truths, Eight-\nfold path, Vipassana and Samatha. \nUnit – 3 \nRational-Emotive Behaviour therapy, Existential Psychoanalysis and therapy, Logic-\nBased Therapy (LBT), Catharasis.  \nUnit – 4 \nDiagnostic case report, Intervention Case Report and Presentation. \n  \n  \nEssential readings \n \n122 \n122 \n1.

The course tries to explore the origins of life and mind by taking insights from sci-\nences of quantum mechanics, systems theory, evolutionary theory, psychology, genetics, \netc. It tries to look across physical, biological, psychological, social scientific, and phe-\nnomenological resources to reach at a consilience for an \"integrated worldview\" to ex-\n123 \n123 \nplain how complex organization, including human life and mind, are structured and how \ndo they function as a part of the whole. \n \nEssential Readings  \n1.

When we ask whether the \nmind can be distinct from the body or what kind of necessity do laws of nature have or \nare cause and effect connected to each other necessarily or does the world exist necessari-\nly or contingently or is it possible for there to be nothing at all or can anything exist with-\nout having an essence or whether a utopia is possible, etc, we are asking questions which \nare distinctly modal in nature. Thus course will focus on the trajectory of understanding \nmodal notions in the twentieth century, starting with three skeptical articles of Quine and \nending with an article of Fine which tries to show that essence is primitive and cannot be \nunderstood in terms of modality.   \n \nEssential Readings  \n \n124 \n124 \n1.

But in resolving the problem with informational iden-\ntities Frege proposed that our thought about the world was mediated by modes of presen-\ntation. Frege thought that whether we used names or indexicals, we connected with the \nworld in either case with a mode of presentation of the object. Russell thought that propo-\nsitions directly contained the objects and not senses. Our knowledge of the world can be \nsaid to be divided on a charitable account into both de re and de dicto propositions. How-\never, we too are part of the world and it seems that first person propositions are not really \npropositions: they are de se reports, and the de se is apparently irreducible to the de re \nand the de dicto. Hence, we have three ways of knowing the objects of the world: de re, \nde dicto and de se. This course is about this trio. \n125 \n125 \n \nEssential Readings \n \n1. Quine, W. V. (1956).
