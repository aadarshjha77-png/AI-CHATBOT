    "text": "Historical Background of Department \nThe Department of Microbiology was established in 1984, initially functioning in the \nUniversity’s main campus at the Patel Chest Institute where classes for the M.Sc. \nMicrobiology program were held. The M.Sc. program was initiated with the enrollment \nof five students each year. The current intake for this program is fifteen students each \nyear. \nThe Department moved to the South Campus in 1986 and became affiliated with the \nFaculty of Interdisciplinary and Applied Sciences upon its establishment in 1988. The \nstudents who graduate from our Master’s program take up positions in \nacademia/industry or pursue higher studies. The Microbiology Department started the \nPh.D. program as well in 1988. Since then, more than one hundred students have carried \nout their doctoral research work in the Department, and several of them now hold \nleadership positions in academia and industry. \n \nDepartment Highlights \n \nThe Department is now well established, currently with seven faculty members. \nExtramural grants from DBT, DST, ICMR, CSIR, UGC, ICAR and DRDO, as well as \nintramural grants from the University of Delhi, have strengthened the Department’s \nresearch. The Department has also been funded under the DST-FIST, UGC-SAP and \nDU-DST PURSE programs. Every faculty member has a well-equipped laboratory with \nthe necessary instruments to carry out research. The departmental Central \nInstrumentation Facility houses several pieces of high-end equipment. More than six \nhundred research papers have been authored by faculty members of the Department in \npeer-reviewed journals of international repute. The achievements of the Department have \nbeen recognized in the form of several awards conferred on the Department’s faculty and \nstudents. \n \nAbout the Program \nThe M.Sc. Microbiology program offered by Delhi University is of two years’ duration \nand is divided into four semesters. The various courses of the program are designed to \ninclude classroom teaching and lectures, laboratory work, project work, viva, seminars, \nand assignments. \nSix categories of courses are being offered in this program: Department Specific Core \n(DSC) Courses, Department Specific Elective (DSE) Courses, Generic Elective (GE) \ncourses (student may opt for any of the Generic Elective courses offered by any other \nDepartment of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary and Applied Sciences), Skill Enhancement \nCourses (SEC), Research methods/ tools/ writing courses, and Dissertation/ Problem-\nbased Research work. The Core Courses and Discipline Specific Elective Courses are \nfour-credit courses. The Generic Electives are also four-credit courses. The student is \nrequired to accumulate twenty-two credits each semester: a total of eighty-eight credits \nover four semesters to fulfill the requirements for a Master of Science degree in \nMicrobiology (two-year program), and forty-four credits over two semesters to fulfill the \nrequirements for a Master of Science degree in Microbiology (one-year program) . \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\nDepartment of Microbiology, University of Delhi, M.Sc. Microbiology Syllabus (NEP-PGCF 2024) \n \nPage | 3  \n \n \nAbout Post-Graduate Attributes \nThe curriculum is designed to train the students in basic and advanced areas of \nMicrobiology, keeping in mind the latest advances in the field. Particular emphasis is \nlaid on the practical aspects of the field. Students are taught how to plan experiments, \nperform them carefully, analyze the data accurately, and present qualitative and \nquantitative results. To enable them to develop speaking and presentation skills they are \nencouraged to deliver seminars on a wide range of topics covering the different areas of \nMicrobiology. This also leads them to read about different themes and enhances their \nassimilation abilities. A major component of their course in Structure 2 and Structure 3 is \na research project they work on in their final year. The student is guided in choosing a \nresearch problem, executing experiments related to it, collecting data and analyzing it, \nand presenting the results in the form of an oral presentation as well as a thesis. The \nstudent presents their research orally at the end of the final semester of the program, \ncoupled with a viva-voce exam. This not only equips the student for a career in research/ \nindustry, but also fosters self-confidence and self-reliance in the student as they learn to \nwork and think independently. At the end of the program the student will be well-versed \nin essential microbiology as well as be familiar with the most recent advances in \nmicrobiology, and will have gained hands-on experience in microbiology, including \nfermentation technology and molecular biology techniques. The student will be able to \ndesign a short research problem, plan and execute experiments to investigate the \nproblem, as well as analyze and present the results obtained both qualitatively and \nquantitatively. The student will be able to take up a suitable position in academia or \nindustry, and be equipped to pursue a career in research if so desired. \nProgram Objectives (POs): \nAt the time of completion of the program the student will have developed extensive \nknowledge in various areas of Microbiology. Through the stimulus of scholarly \nprogression and intellectual development the program aims to equip students with \nexcellence in education and skills, thus enabling them to pursue a career of their choice. \nBy cultivating talents and promoting all-round personality development through multi-\ndimensional education, a spirit of self-confidence and self-reliance will be infused in the \nstudent. The student will be instilled with values of professional ethics and be made ready \nto contribute to society as responsible individuals. \nProgram",

Microbiology program is a two-year program divided into four semesters, or a \none-year program divided into two semesters. A student has to accumulate twenty-two \ncredits in each semester. Under the two-year M.Sc. program a student is required to \ncomplete eighty-eight credits for completion and award of M.Sc. degree, while under the \none-year M.Sc. program a student is required to complete forty-four credits for \ncompletion and award of M.Sc. degree. The program structure is based on the Post \nGraduate Curricular Framework (PGCF) under New Education Policy (NEP)-2020.  \n \nUnder PGCF, in the first year of the two-year program, the student is required to study \nmandatory Discipline Specific Core courses (three DSC in each semester) and a total of \nfour / Discipline Specific Elective courses (two DSE in each Semester). In lieu of one \nDSE in each Semester, the student may choose to study a Generic Elective course offered \nby any other Department of FIAS. In addition, the student will also be required to study \none mandatory Skill enhancement course (SEC) in each semester of the first year. \n  \nIn the second year of the two-year program, the student will have an option to choose any \none of the three structures: Structure 1 (PG with only coursework), Structure 2 (PG with \ncoursework and research), or Structure 3 (PG with coursework and more \nemphasis/weightage on research). The details regarding these structures have been \nsummarized in tabular form.  \n \n \nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\nDepartment of Microbiology, University of Delhi, M.Sc.
