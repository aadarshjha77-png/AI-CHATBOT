    "text": "Operational Research (OR) as a subject was introduced in the University of Delhi in 1963 \nwith the introduction of a two year post graduate programme. A decade later in 1973, the \nDepartment of Operational Research was independently set up under the Faculty of \nMathematical Sciences. It is the first department to start a post graduate programme in \nOperational Research in India. \nThe Department of Operational Research, since its very inception, has been vigorously \nengaged in research and the Master of Operational Research (MOR) programme at the \nDepartment provides unparalleled depth and experience for students in the subject area of \nOperational Research. The programme prepares students from different backgrounds for \nrewarding careers as OR Analysts, Data Scientists and Consultants. The two-year programme \noffers a unique blend of technical courses, practical consulting skills and real world problem \nsolving experience designed to position students for success in today’s competitive business \nworld. \nIn 1994, the Department also introduced the Post Graduate Programme at South Campus, \nUniversity of Delhi. The Department also offers M.Phil. and Ph.D. programmes in \nOperational Research.  \nThe cornerstone of the programme is the Industrial Project where every student is matched \nwith an industry partner to consult on a significant operational issue faced by the company. \nWorking closely with the faculty members and project mentors, each student defines the \nproblem to be solved, collects relevant information, builds mathematical models and delivers \ndecision tools and executive level recommendations to the industry partner. The project \noutcomes are valued so highly by the industry partners that they hire the students to continue \ntheir work with them after completing their degree.",

The courses will be evaluated \nfollowing the grading system, which is considered to be better than the conventional marks \nsystem. Grading system provides uniformity in the evaluation and computation of the \nCumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on student’s performance in examinations \nwhich enables the student to move across institutions of higher learning. The uniformity in \nevaluation system also enables the potential employers in assessing the performance of the \ncandidates.",
