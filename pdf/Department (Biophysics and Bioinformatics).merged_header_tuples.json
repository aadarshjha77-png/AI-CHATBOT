    "text": "Department Highlights \n \nThe Department of Biophysics was established in 1984 and is part of the FIAS (Faculty of \nInterdisciplinary and Applied Sciences) at the University of Delhi South Campus. The \ndepartment currently has five faculty members engaged in various research areas in \nBiophysics and Bioinformatics. \n \nAbout the Program \nThe M.Sc. Biophysics and Bioinformatics program offered by Delhi University is of two \nyears’ duration and is divided into four semesters. The various courses of the program are \ndesigned to include classroom teaching and lectures, hands-on practical and tutorials, dry and \nwet laboratory work, and dissertations.  \nSix categories of courses are being offered in this program: Discipline Specific Core Courses \n(DSC), Discipline Specific Elective Courses (DSE), Generic Elective Courses (GE), Skill \nBased courses (SB), Research methods/ tools/ writing courses under Research Track (RT), \nand Dissertation Research work. Students may opt for any Generic Elective courses offered \nby any other Department of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary and Applied Sciences. The Core \nCourses, the Elective Courses and Generic Electives are four credit courses each. As per the \nUniversity guidelines, the student is required to accumulate twenty-two credits each semester, \na total of eighty-eight credits, to fulfill the requirements for a Master of Science (PG) degree \nin Biophysics and Bioinformatics.  \nThe M.Sc. in Biophysics and Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary program designed to \nbridge the gap between biology, physics, and computational sciences. The course integrates \nbiophysical principles, molecular biology, computational biology, and bioinformatics to \ngenerate, interpret, and analyze large-scale biological datasets.

Biophysics and Bioinformatics program is divided into four semesters. The \nprogram structure is based on the Post Graduate Curricular Framework (PGCF) under (New \nEducation Policy) NEP-2020.  \nThe student is required to complete eighty-eight credits for the completion of the course and \nthe award of a degree. The student has to accumulate twenty-two credits in each of the four \nsemesters. \nUnder PGCF, during the first year of the program, the student is required to study mandatory \nsix Discipline Specific Core courses (three DSC in each semester), and a total of four \nDiscipline Specific Elective courses (two DSE in each semester). The student can also opt for \n1GE from another sister department from FIAS instead, thus making this combination as \n1DSE+1GE. In addition, the student will also be required to study 1 mandatory Skill based \ncourse (SBC) of 2 credits in each semester of the first year.  \n  \nIn the second year of the program, the student will choose any one of the three structures: \nProgram Structure 1 (PG with only coursework), or Program Structure 2 (PG with coursework \nand research), or Program Structure 3 (PG with research) as per the university guidelines. The \ndetails of the course credits and the courses available under each category of courses (DSC, \nDSE, GE, SB, RT) are elaborated in the tables ahead.  \n \nA minimum of 75% attendance in the practical and theory classes would be mandatory \nrequirement for appearing in exams and obtaining the degree. \n \n \n5\nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n \n \nCourse Credit Scheme \n \nProgram Structure-1: \n (PG with only coursework) \n \nSem \nCore courses \n(DSC) \nElective \ncourses \n(DSE/GE) \nSkill based \ncourses (SB) \nRes Track  \ncourses (RT) \nDissertation/ \nProject \nTotal \nCredits \n \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \n \nI \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nII \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nIII \n2 \n8 \n3 \n12 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nIV \n2 \n8 \n3 \n12 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nTotal \nCredits \n40 \n40 \n8 \n- \n- \n88 \n \nProgram Structure-2: \n(PG with coursework + research) \n \nSem \nCore courses \n(DSC) \nElective \ncourses \n(DSE/GE) \nSkill based \ncourses (SB) \nRes Track \ncourses (RT) \nDissertation/ \nProject \nTotal \nCredits \n \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \n \nI \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nII \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nIII \n2 \n8 \n2 \n8 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n1 \n6 \n22 \nIV \n2 \n8 \n2 \n8 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n1 \n6 \n22 \nTotal \nCredits \n40 \n32 \n4 \n- \n12 \n88 \n \nProgram Structure-3: \n(PG with research) \n \nSem \nCore courses \n(DSC) \nElective \ncourses \n(DSE/GE) \nSkill based \ncourses (SB) \nRes Track \ncourses (RT) \nDissertation/ \nProject \nTotal \nCredits \n \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \nNo. of \nCourses \nTotal \nCredit \n \nI \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nII \n3 \n12 \n2 \n8 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n22 \nIII \n1 \n4 \n1 \n4 \n- \n- \n2 \n4 \n1 \n10 \n22 \nIV \n- \n- \n1 \n4 \n- \n- \n1 \n2 \n1 \n16 \n22 \nTotal \nCredits \n28 \n24 \n4 \n6 \n26 \n88 \n \n \n6\nEC (1275) - 23.05.2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSEMESTER-WISE PROGRAM STRUCTURE of M.Sc.
