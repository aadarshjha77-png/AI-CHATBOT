    "text": "The history of the Department of Sanskrit, DU begins with the history of the University \nitself. The Department came into existence in 1922 when the University had come into \nexistence. During the first two years of its commencement the Department ran without \npostgraduate students. It was only in 1924 that the Department had one student in its M.A. \nprogram. Following the practice of the time Mahamahopadhyaya Pandit Lachhmi Dhar \nKalla, the senior most of the teachers among the constituent colleges of the University \noccupied the position of Teacher-in-charge of the Department. As the Department had no \nfaculty members of its own, officially recognized some of the senior teachers from the \ncolleges as Readers.  \n  \n \nMahamahopadhyaya Pandit Lachhmi Dhar Kalla \n \nPandit Lachhmi Dhar Kalla, the first in-charge of the Department belonged to St. Stephen's \nCollege. Those days the Postgraduate classes of the subject of Sanskrit were held at St. \nStephen's College. Pandit Kalla pioneered the research programs in the Department of \nInformation Brochure, Department of Sanskrit \n \n2 \n \nSanskrit. He had come to the department with an illustrious background to his credit. After \ncompleting an archeological apprenticeship under Sir John Marshal, he had joined St. \nStephen’s College as a lecturer in October 1916. He was an elected member of the Royal \nAsiatic Society. Apart from being well-versed in several Indian languages, he had the \nknowledge of Persian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, German, French, Russian and English. His \nbooks ‘The Birthplace of Kalidasa’ and ‘The Homeland of Aryans’ got high accreditations \nfrom the scholars across the globe. It goes without saying that his contributions in building \nthe Department are unparalleled.  \nDr. N.N.Choudhuri of Ramjas College took over as Head of the Department in the year 1949. \nA full-fledged University Department saw its inception only in the year 1953 when a post of \nReader in Sanskrit was created and filled up. \n \n \nDr. N.N.

Even in the late fifties, there used to be only five or six \nstudents in its M.A. program and one or two students in Ph.D. program. This situation \ncontinued for a number of years. It was only during the early sixties that a marked \nimprovement in the numbers of students was seen. From being a small Department it has now \ngrown to be one of the biggest Departments in the University with more than three hundred \npostgraduate students, more than one hundred fifty research scholars and more than one \nhundred fifty teachers in colleges and the University Department. \nThe Department of Sanskrit enjoys the pride of having some of the stalwarts in the subject as \nits faculties in the past.

He has the credits of publishing \nbooks and articles in all these languages. He has published the books from USA, Europe and \nIndia. He has composed fifteen Kāvyas and Mahākāvyas in Sanskrit and has edited and \ntranslated several books with detailed introductions and critical notes.
