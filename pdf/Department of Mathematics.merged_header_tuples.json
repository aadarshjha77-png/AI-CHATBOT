    "header": "I. About the Department",
    "text": "The Department of Mathematics, University of Delhi took birth in 1947, with Prof. Ram \nBehari, an eminent Differential Geometer, as Head of the Department.  Several distinguished \nmathematicians have been part of the Department’s long and successful journey so far, Prof. \nR. S. Varma and Prof. U.N. Singh among them. While research activities in Operations \nResearch, Information Theory, Coding Theory, Space Dynamics and Complex Analysis \nblossomed under the former’s leadership, the latter made the Department a very strong, global \nresearch hub for Functional Analysis, Operator Theory and Harmonic Analysis. As the \nactivities of the Department grew exponentially, in 1973, the single department \nmetamorphosed into the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences with four constituent departments: \nMathematics, Operations Research, Statistics and Computer Science. The South Campus unit \nof the Department of Mathematics also came into being in 1973. The Department of \nMathematics continues to uphold the high traditions of teaching and research which have \nshaped it from the very beginning. \nThe Mathematics Department offers a masters programme in Mathematics besides two \nresearch programmes, the M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Mathematics. Nearly hundred students have \nbeen awarded Ph.D. degrees in the last five years. The department is also actively involved in \nadministering the University’s undergraduate programmes in Mathematics.  We are supported \nby grants from DST(FIST), DST(PURSE) and UGC-DRS(SAP). Our excellent and highly \nexperienced faculty, with  qualifications from premier institutions and expertise in diverse \nfields including Algebraic Geometry, Coding Theory, Complex Analysis, Commutative \nAlgebra, Combinatorics, Control Theory, Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, \nErgodic Theory, Field Theory, Fluid Dynamics, Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, \nOperator Theory, Operator Algebras, Optimization and Topology, has helped us in securing \nhigh positions  in various national and international rankings. For example, we are ranked 10 \nin Times Higher Education Ranking in India and 144 in Asia in 2018.  Several faculty \nmembers are or have been fellows of prestigious national science academies and recipients of \nawards of excellence from such academies. Many members are also actively involved as \nconsultant/advisor for UGC, DST, CSIR, UPSC, Lok Sabha and are on advisory committees \nof several universities in the country. \n The M.Sc. Mathematics programme, aims to build strong foundations in core areas of higher \nmathematics in both the pure and applied areas. It is meant for students who would typically \ntake up careers involving mathematical research or mathematical skills – in academia or in \nindustry. The training imparted to the students helps them master the art of problem solving, \ndeveloping logical reasoning and computational capabilities which are essential traits in all \nwalks of life. Additionally, the knowledge of mathematical modeling and computational \ntraining which the students acquire during the programme makes them highly sought after. In \nkeeping with the demands of industry and academia, the syllabus is updated regularly, with \ninputs taken from various stakeholders including students, alumni and parents at different \nstages of the preparation of the syllabus. \n4",

    "text": "Scope:  \nThe CBCS provides an opportunity for the students to choose courses from the prescribed \ncourses comprising core, elective/minor or skill-based courses. The courses can be evaluated \nfollowing the grading system, which is considered to be better than the conventional marks \nsystem. Grading system provides uniformity in the evaluation and computation of the \nCumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on student’s performance in examinations \nwhich enables the student to move across institutions of higher learning. The uniformity in \nevaluation system also enable the potential employers in assessing the performance of the \ncandidates. \nDefinitions: \n(i) ‘Academic Programme’ means an entire course of study comprising its programme \nstructure, course details, evaluation schemes etc. designed to be taught and evaluated in a \nteaching Department/Centre or jointly under more than one such Department/ Centre. \n(ii) ‘Course’ means a segment of a subject that is part of an Academic Programme \n(iii) ‘Programme Structure’ means a list of courses (Core, Elective, Open Elective) that makes \nup an Academic Programme, specifying the syllabus, Credits, hours of teaching, evaluation \nand examination schemes, minimum number of credits required for successful completion of \nthe programme etc. prepared in conformity to University Rules, eligibility criteria for \nadmission. \n(iv) ‘Core Course’ means a course that a student admitted to a particular programme must \nsuccessfully complete to receive the degree and which cannot be substituted by any other \ncourse. \n(v) ‘Elective Course’ means an optional course to be selected by a student out of such courses \noffered in the same or any other Department/Centre \n(vi) ‘Open Elective’ means an elective course which is available for students of all \nprogrammes, including students of same department. Students of other Department will opt \nthese courses subject to fulfilling of eligibility of criteria as laid down by the Department \noffering the course. \n(vii) ‘Credit’ means the value assigned to a course which indicates the level of instruction; \nOne-hour lecture per week equals 1 Credit, 2 hours practical class per week equals 1 credit. \nCredit for a practical could be proposed as part of a course or as a separate practical course  \n(viii) ‘SGPA’ means Semester Grade Point Average calculated for individual semester. \n(ix) ‘CGPA’ is Cumulative Grade Points Average calculated for all courses completed by the \nstudents at any point of time. CGPA is calculated each year for both the semesters clubbed \ntogether. \n(x) ‘Grand CGPA’ is calculated in the last year of the course by clubbing together of CGPA \nof two years, that is, four semesters. Grand CGPA is being given in Transcript form. To benefit \nthe student a formula for conversation of Grand CGPA into %age marks is given in the \nTranscript. \n5",

    "text": "Programme Objectives (POs): \nThe M.Sc. Mathematics programme’s main objectives are  \n To inculcate and develop mathematical aptitude and the ability to think abstractly in the \nstudent. \n To develop computational abilities and programming skills. \n To develop in the student the ability to read, follow and appreciate mathematical text. \n Train students to communicate mathematical ideas in a lucid and effective manner. \n To train students to apply their theoretical knowledge to solve problems.   \n To encourage the use of relevant software such as MATLAB and MATHEMATICA. \n \nProgramme Specific Outcomes (PSOs): \nOn successful completion of the M.Sc. Mathematics programme a student will  \n Have a strong foundation in core areas of Mathematics, both pure and applied. \n Be able to apply mathematical skills and logical reasoning for problem solving. \n Communicate mathematical ideas effectively, in writing as well as orally. \n Have sound knowledge of mathematical modeling, programming and computational \ntechniques as required for employment in industry.  \nProgramme Structure: \nThe M.Sc. Mathematics programme is a two-year course divided into four semesters. A \nstudent is required to complete at least 80 credits for the completion of the course and the \naward of degree.
