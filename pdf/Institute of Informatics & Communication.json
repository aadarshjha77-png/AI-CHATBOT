    "text": "Information Technology integrates a wide spectrum of knowledge and skill ranging from the \ndesign of computer hardware, software systems, and telecommunication to the impact of \ninformation technology on society. To achieve this holistic goal the Institute of Informatics & \nCommunication (IIC) was established in 1997 with the following objectives: \n \n• To serve as an inter-disciplinary centre for humanities, social sciences, pure and applied \nsciences and as a nodal point between university and various Institutions/Industries, \nrelated to communication and informatics. \n• To conduct professional / socially relevant post-graduate teaching programmes, \nindependently or in collaboration with various departments on different aspects on \ncommunication and informatics. \n• To conduct research on various aspects of informatics and communication. \n \nThe Institute of Informatics and Communication of the University of Delhi South Campus is a \nunique institution from several points of view. For one, it offers a two-year M.Sc. (Informatics) \nthat combines high-end knowledge with useful real world applications in several areas of \ninformation technology and communications. For another, it trains the student to think \nanalytically and imparts a degree of maturity and independence to the student through some \ninnovative schemes. The Institute also trains its students to imbibe the ability to stay abreast with \nrecent developments in the various areas that are related to Informatics so that they are able to \nperform at optimum levels in their subsequent professional careers. The curriculum at Institute of \nInformatics and Communication (IIC) attempts to prepare its graduates for meaningful and \nchallenging jobs in IT Industry. The learning environment in the Institute encourages initiative, \nteamwork and development of entrepreneurial skills. \nThe learning approach at IIC includes classroom lectures, tutorials, project assignment and \nInternet access. The students are encouraged to develop their skills and acquire theoretical \nknowledge and practical training in electronics, telecommunication and computer hardware and \nsoftware. To improve the communication skills of students and to increase their confidence, \nstudents are required to make presentations with the help of visual aids during the fortnightly \nseminar sessions. \nThe selection process to enter the Postgraduate programme is rigorous and the number of seats is \nrestricted to ensure quality education. The Institute provides an excellent environment for \nlearning and innovation. IIC aims towards the development of intense research activity in various \nareas of Informatics and Telecommunications, and towards participating in national and \ninternational competitive research and development projects to attract external resources. The \nresearch staff of the IIC Department is thriving for quality work have published papers in leading \nscientific journals, have developed important national cooperations with related departments \nabroad, and participate in scientific committees of prestigious international and conferences. \n \n \n \n \n                M.Sc.

    "text": "Choice Based Credit System \nThe CBCS provides an opportunity for the students to choose courses from the prescribed \ncourses comprising core, elective/minor or skill-based courses. The courses can be evaluated \nfollowing the grading system, which is considered to be better than the conventional marks \nsystem. Grading system provides uniformity in the evaluation and computation of the \nCumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on student’s performance in examinations \nwhich enables the student to move across institutions of higher learning. The uniformity in \nevaluation system also enable the potential employers in assessing the performance of the \ncandidates. \nDefinitions: \n(i) \n‘Academic Programme’ means an entire course of study comprising its programme \nstructure, course details, evaluation schemes etc. designed to be taught and evaluated in a \nteaching Department/Centre or jointly under more than one such Department/ Centre \n(ii) \n‘Course’ means a segment of a subject that is part of an Academic Programme \n(iii) ‘Programme Structure’ means a list of courses (Core, Elective, Open Elective) that makes \nup an Academic Programme, specifying the syllabus, Credits, hours of teaching, evaluation \nand examination schemes, minimum number of credits required for successful completion \nof the programme etc. prepared in conformity to University Rules, eligibility criteria for \nadmission \n(iv) ‘Core Course’ means a course that a student admitted to a particular programme must \nsuccessfully complete to receive the degree and which cannot be substituted by any other \ncourse \n(v) \n‘Elective Course’ means an optional course to be selected by a student out of such courses \noffered in the same or any other Department/Centre \n(vi) ‘Open Elective’ means an elective course which is available for students of all \nprogrammes, including students of same department. Students of other Department will opt \nthese courses subject to fulfilling of eligibility of criteria as laid down by the Department \noffering the course. \n(vii) ‘Credit’ means the value assigned to a course which indicates the level of instruction; One- \nhour lecture per week equals 1 Credit, 2 hours practical class per week equals 1 credit. \nCredit for a practical could be proposed as part of a course or as a separate practical course \n(viii) ‘SGPA’ means Semester Grade Point Average calculated for individual semester. \n(ix) ‘CGPA’ is Cumulative Grade Points Average calculated for all courses completed by the \nstudents at any point of time. CGPA is calculated each year for both the semesters clubbed \ntogether. \n(x) \n‘Grand CGPA’ is calculated in the last year of the course by clubbing together of CGPA of \ntwo years, i.e., four semesters. Grand CGPA is being given in Transcript form. To benefit \nthe student a formula for conversation of Grand CGPA into %age marks is given in the \nTranscript. \n \n \n \n \n                M.Sc.
